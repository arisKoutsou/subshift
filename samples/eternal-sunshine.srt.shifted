1
00:01:29,741 --> 00:01:31,159
"Thank you"

2
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,460
Random thoughts...

3
00:01:37,668 --> 00:01:40,421
for Valentine's Day, 2004.

4
00:01:41,882 --> 00:01:44,969
Today is a holiday invented
by greeting card companies...

5
00:01:45,929 --> 00:01:48,724
to make people
feel like crap.

6
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:53,647
I ditched work today.

7
00:01:56,235 --> 00:01:58,112
Took a train out to Montauk.

8
00:02:00,657 --> 00:02:02,409
I don't know why.

9
00:02:04,204 --> 00:02:06,206
Aah!
I'm not an impulsive person.

10
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:16,553
I guess I just woke up
in a funk this morning.

11
00:02:17,555 --> 00:02:19,557
I gotta get my car fixed.

12
00:02:19,891 --> 00:02:21,309
Hi. Cindy?

13
00:02:21,352 --> 00:02:22,520
It's Joel.

14
00:02:23,396 --> 00:02:24,689
Joel!

15
00:02:24,731 --> 00:02:26,900
Listen, I don't
feel very well today.

16
00:02:28,445 --> 00:02:30,572
No, food poisoning,
I think.

17
00:02:31,031 --> 00:02:33,409
It's goddamn freezing on this beach.

18
00:02:34,035 --> 00:02:36,705
Montauk in February.
Brilliant, Joel.

19
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:40,960
Page is ripped out.

20
00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:42,755
Don't remember doing that.

21
00:02:45,634 --> 00:02:48,971
It appears this is
my first entry in two years.

22
00:02:57,817 --> 00:02:59,569
Sand is overrated.

23
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:02,865
It's just tiny little rocks.

24
00:03:12,545 --> 00:03:14,464
If only I could
meet someone new.

25
00:03:16,133 --> 00:03:19,137
I guess my chances of that happening
are somewhat diminished,

26
00:03:19,179 --> 00:03:22,057
seeing that I'm incapable of making
eye contact with a woman

27
00:03:22,058 --> 00:03:23,267
I don't know.

28
00:03:25,062 --> 00:03:27,440
Maybe I should
get back together with Naomi

29
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:29,776
She was nice.

30
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:31,737
Nice is good.

31
00:03:33,907 --> 00:03:35,409
She loved me.

32
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,170
Why do I fall in love
with every woman I see...

33
00:04:15,212 --> 00:04:17,840
who shows me
the least bit of attention?

34
00:04:59,939 --> 00:05:00,940
Hi.

35
00:05:01,774 --> 00:05:02,775
I'm sorry?

36
00:05:02,817 --> 00:05:04,360
- I just said hi.

37
00:05:04,445 --> 00:05:05,780
- Hi. Hello. Hi.

38
00:05:07,532 --> 00:05:09,159
Okay if I sit closer?

39
00:05:11,955 --> 00:05:13,123
How far are you going?

40
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:15,835
Uh, Rockville Center.

41
00:05:15,876 --> 00:05:17,544
Get out! Me too!

42
00:05:17,796 --> 00:05:19,798
Really?
What are the odds?

43
00:05:23,011 --> 00:05:24,513
Do I know You?

44
00:05:28,018 --> 00:05:29,853
Do you ever shop
at Barnes & Noble?

45
00:05:29,895 --> 00:05:31,230
Sure. Sure.

46
00:05:31,272 --> 00:05:32,815
That's it!
Yeah?

47
00:05:32,857 --> 00:05:34,692
I've seen you, man!

48
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,029
Book slave there
for, like -

49
00:05:37,572 --> 00:05:39,032
Five years now.

50
00:05:39,617 --> 00:05:41,703
Ah.- Jesus!
- I would have thought
I would've remembered you.

51
00:05:41,744 --> 00:05:43,538
Is it five years?
It might be the hair.

52
00:05:44,289 --> 00:05:47,459
What might?
It changes a lot. The color.

53
00:05:47,502 --> 00:05:49,546
That's why you might not
recognize me.

54
00:05:50,047 --> 00:05:51,715
It's called Blue Ruin,
Right.

55
00:05:53,385 --> 00:05:55,512
Snappy name, huh?
I like it.

56
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:00,644
Anyway, this company
makes a whole line of colors

57
00:06:00,686 --> 00:06:02,062
With equally snappy names.

58
00:06:02,814 --> 00:06:04,274
Red-- Red Menace,
Yellow Fever,

59
00:06:04,441 --> 00:06:06,109
Green Revolution.

60
00:06:07,112 --> 00:06:09,114
That'd be a job,
coming up with those names.

61
00:06:09,114 --> 00:06:11,784
You think there could
possibly be a job like that?

62
00:06:12,118 --> 00:06:14,120
I mean, how many hair
colors could there be?

63
00:06:14,955 --> 00:06:16,123
Fifty, maybe.

64
00:06:16,332 --> 00:06:18,251
Someone's got that job.

65
00:06:19,461 --> 00:06:22,172
Agent Orange!
I came up with that one.

66
00:06:23,342 --> 00:06:25,803
I apply my personality
in a paste.

67
00:06:26,095 --> 00:06:28,139
Oh, I doubt that very much.

68
00:06:28,974 --> 00:06:30,642
Well, you don't know me,
so...

69
00:06:31,853 --> 00:06:33,647
You don't know, do you?

70
00:06:36,693 --> 00:06:39,154
Sorry. I was just--

71
00:06:39,196 --> 00:06:40,656
I'm trying to be nice.

72
00:06:41,991 --> 00:06:44,160
Yeah. I got it.

73
00:07:03,312 --> 00:07:05,565
My name's Clementine,
by the way.

74
00:07:05,815 --> 00:07:06,983
I'm Joel.

75
00:07:06,983 --> 00:07:07,984
Hi, Joel.
Hey.

76
00:07:09,737 --> 00:07:11,364
No jokes about my name.

77
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:13,700
Oh, no, you wouldn't do that.

78
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:15,702
You're trying to be nice.

79
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,247
I don't know any jokes
about your name.

80
00:07:18,707 --> 00:07:20,417
Huckleberry Hound.

81
00:07:21,586 --> 00:07:23,296
I don't know what that means.

82
00:07:23,338 --> 00:07:24,756
Huckleberry Hound?

83
00:07:25,591 --> 00:07:27,885
What are you, nuts?
It's been suggested.

84
00:07:28,846 --> 00:07:32,267
- Oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin'
Oh, my darlin' Clementine -

85
00:07:32,517 --> 00:07:35,145
- You were lost
and gone forever -

86
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:37,566
- Dreadful sorry
Clementine --

87
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:39,735
No?
I'm sorry.

88
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,906
Just- It's a pretty name, though.
It really is nice.

89
00:07:42,906 --> 00:07:45,033
It's, uh--
It means ''merciful.''

90
00:07:45,076 --> 00:07:47,495
Right? Clemency?

91
00:07:47,537 --> 00:07:49,164
Although it hardly fits.

92
00:07:49,206 --> 00:07:51,542
I'm a vindictive little bitch,
truth be told.

93
00:07:51,543 --> 00:07:53,837
Gee, I-I wouldn't
think that about you.

94
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:55,673
Why wouldn't you
think that about me?

95
00:07:56,424 --> 00:07:58,051
I don't know...
I just--

96
00:07:59,971 --> 00:08:01,514
I don't know.
I just, uh--

97
00:08:02,182 --> 00:08:04,309
You seem nice, so--

98
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,686
Oh, now I'm nice?

99
00:08:06,688 --> 00:08:09,066
Oh, God. Don't you know
any other adjectives?

100
00:08:09,066 --> 00:08:10,609
I don't need ''nice.''

101
00:08:10,652 --> 00:08:12,070
I don't need myself to be it, and -

102
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:14,531
I don't need myself to be it,
and I don't need anybody else to be it at me.
Okay.

103
00:08:19,163 --> 00:08:20,414
Joel?

104
00:08:21,249 --> 00:08:22,751
It's Joel, right?

105
00:08:24,211 --> 00:08:25,254
Yes.

106
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,425
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

107
00:08:29,385 --> 00:08:31,429
I'm a little out of sorts today.

108
00:08:41,568 --> 00:08:42,777
My embarrassing admission is,

109
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,947
I really like
that you're nice

110
00:08:44,989 --> 00:08:46,449
Right now, I mean...

111
00:08:47,784 --> 00:08:49,995
I can't tell from one moment
to the next what I'm gonna like,

112
00:08:50,163 --> 00:08:52,833
But right now...

113
00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:55,336
I'm glad you are.

114
00:09:03,514 --> 00:09:05,266
I have so much stuff
that, uh, I

115
00:09:05,433 --> 00:09:06,851
Probably should, uh--

116
00:09:09,856 --> 00:09:11,441
Oh! I'm sorry. Okay.
I-I'm writing, and--

117
00:09:11,858 --> 00:09:13,526
No, no. I just--
Sure. No. That's okay.

118
00:09:13,569 --> 00:09:15,696
I just have--
You know, this is--
Okay.

119
00:09:17,866 --> 00:09:18,700
- Ohh! Hey!
- Take care, then.

120
00:09:18,868 --> 00:09:20,203
Jesus.!

121
00:09:33,846 --> 00:09:34,847
Hi!

122
00:09:35,265 --> 00:09:38,519
I could, uh, give you
a ride, if you need.

123
00:09:39,604 --> 00:09:40,605
It's cold.

124
00:09:40,772 --> 00:09:42,482
Yeah. Okay. Yeah.
Yeah?

125
00:09:42,524 --> 00:09:43,942
It is frosty.

126
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,778
You're not a stalker
or anything, right?

127
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:48,615
I'm not a stalker.
You're the one that talked to me.
Remember?

128
00:09:48,657 --> 00:09:50,951
That is the oldest trick
in the stalker book.

129
00:09:50,994 --> 00:09:52,078
Really?

130
00:09:52,371 --> 00:09:53,956
There's a stalker book?

131
00:09:56,293 --> 00:09:57,961
I gotta read that one.

132
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:06,514
Look, I'm sorry if I
came off sorta nutso.

133
00:10:06,723 --> 00:10:08,266
I'm not, really.

134
00:10:08,309 --> 00:10:09,852
Oh, it's okay.

135
00:10:09,936 --> 00:10:11,730
I didn't think you were.

136
00:10:17,362 --> 00:10:18,864
Did you wanna have a drink?

137
00:10:20,033 --> 00:10:22,703
I have lots of drinks,
and I could, um--

138
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:26,123
Um-- Never mind.

139
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:28,168
Sorry. That was stupid.
I'm embarrassed now.

140
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,878
No, no, no, no.
Good night, Joel.

141
00:10:50,073 --> 00:10:52,075
Two Blue Ruins.

142
00:10:54,078 --> 00:10:56,915
Thank you.
Drink up, young man.

143
00:10:57,332 --> 00:11:00,461
It'll make
the whole seduction part
less repugnant.

144
00:11:04,092 --> 00:11:06,720
I'm just kidding!
Come on!

145
00:11:13,312 --> 00:11:15,565
You're kinda closed-mouthed,
aren't you?

146
00:11:15,607 --> 00:11:18,485
I'm sorry. It's just,

147
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,447
My life isn't that -

148
00:11:20,488 --> 00:11:22,574
Interesting.

149
00:11:22,825 --> 00:11:24,285
I go to work

150
00:11:24,327 --> 00:11:25,829
I come home.

151
00:11:26,663 --> 00:11:28,081
Don't know what to say.

152
00:11:29,167 --> 00:11:31,336
You should read my journal.

153
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,214
I mean, it's just...

154
00:11:34,507 --> 00:11:36,509
Blank.
Really?

155
00:11:36,885 --> 00:11:38,220
Does that make you
sad or anxious?

156
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,221
I mean,

157
00:11:39,514 --> 00:11:41,224
I'm always anxious, thinking
I'm not living my life

158
00:11:41,266 --> 00:11:42,392
To the fullest,

159
00:11:42,393 --> 00:11:44,479
Taking advantage
of every possibility,

160
00:11:44,521 --> 00:11:45,814
Making sure
I'm not wasting

161
00:11:45,856 --> 00:11:47,566
One second of the
little time I have.

162
00:11:48,234 --> 00:11:50,528
I think about that.
Yeah?

163
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:57,204
You're really nice.

164
00:11:57,872 --> 00:12:00,917
Ohh!
God, I have to
stop saying that.

165
00:12:02,545 --> 00:12:04,213
I'm gonna marry you.

166
00:12:04,339 --> 00:12:05,799
I know it.

167
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:09,094
Um... okay.

168
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,061
Joel,

169
00:12:15,604 --> 00:12:18,149
You should come up to the
Charles with me sometime.

170
00:12:18,524 --> 00:12:20,318
It gets frozen this time of year.

171
00:12:20,485 --> 00:12:22,654
That sounds scary.
Exactly.

172
00:12:23,489 --> 00:12:25,157
I'll pack a picnic.

173
00:12:25,534 --> 00:12:26,994
A night picnic.

174
00:12:27,161 --> 00:12:29,998
Night picnic is
different. And, um,

175
00:12:30,665 --> 00:12:32,709
We could--
Sounds good.

176
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:36,047
But I-- I should, uh, go.
Now.

177
00:12:37,049 --> 00:12:39,802
You should stay.
No, I really-- I'm--

178
00:12:39,844 --> 00:12:40,845
I--

179
00:12:40,887 --> 00:12:44,016
I have to get up so early.
I would like you to call me.

180
00:12:44,309 --> 00:12:45,685
Would you do that?

181
00:12:45,978 --> 00:12:47,605
I would like it.

182
00:12:47,646 --> 00:12:48,855
Yes.

183
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:55,365
Wish me a happy Valentine's Day
when you call!

184
00:12:55,866 --> 00:12:57,701
That'd be nice.

185
00:13:38,464 --> 00:13:40,299
What took you so long?

186
00:13:40,634 --> 00:13:41,969
I just walked in.

187
00:13:43,179 --> 00:13:45,014
Mm-hmm. You miss me?

188
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:47,559
Yeah.
Oddly enough, I do.

189
00:13:47,602 --> 00:13:49,938
Oh! You said ''I do.''

190
00:13:49,938 --> 00:13:52,191
I guess that means were married.

191
00:13:52,191 --> 00:13:53,818
I guess so.

192
00:13:54,069 --> 00:13:55,362
Tomorrow night?

193
00:13:55,404 --> 00:13:56,864
Honeymoon on ice?

194
00:13:56,947 --> 00:13:58,949
It's really solid
this time of year.

195
00:14:00,202 --> 00:14:02,455
Whoa! I don't know.
Eee!

196
00:14:03,081 --> 00:14:05,000
Come on.
Come on, come on.

197
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:12,385
Oh. So beautiful.

198
00:14:13,678 --> 00:14:15,054
Isn't it?

199
00:14:19,561 --> 00:14:21,229
Uh, don't go too far.
- Whoo! Oww! Ow!
- Whoa! Oh!

200
00:14:23,608 --> 00:14:25,276
- Are you okay?
- Ouch!

201
00:14:29,282 --> 00:14:31,284
Ohh.! Oh, my ass.!

202
00:14:32,954 --> 00:14:34,831
I think I should go back.
Come on!

203
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:36,917
Come on!
What if it breaks?

204
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:39,963
- ''What if'?
Do you really care right now?
- Huh?

205
00:14:40,631 --> 00:14:42,717
Come here. Please.

206
00:14:49,977 --> 00:14:52,647
Slidy-slidy.
Slidy-slidy.
Whoa!

207
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,565
This is good.

208
00:14:54,608 --> 00:14:56,652
Here, let me show you
this one thing.
Whoa.

209
00:15:00,991 --> 00:15:02,200
Come on.

210
00:15:07,792 --> 00:15:09,919
Think I heard a crack.

211
00:15:10,045 --> 00:15:12,298
It's not gonna crack

212
00:15:12,298 --> 00:15:15,009
Or break or-- It's so thick.

213
00:15:17,221 --> 00:15:19,724
Show me which constellations
you know.

214
00:15:20,058 --> 00:15:21,101
Um-- Oh.

215
00:15:22,729 --> 00:15:25,315
I don't... know any.

216
00:15:26,734 --> 00:15:28,736
Show me
which ones you know.

217
00:15:28,737 --> 00:15:30,489
Okay.

218
00:15:31,741 --> 00:15:32,909
Okay.

219
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,748
Oh. Here's Osidius.

220
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:38,916
Where?

221
00:15:39,584 --> 00:15:42,921
Right there. See?
Sort of a swoop

222
00:15:42,922 --> 00:15:44,298
And a cross.

223
00:15:44,424 --> 00:15:46,843
Osidius the Emphatic.

224
00:15:48,138 --> 00:15:49,806
You're full of shit.
Right?

225
00:15:49,806 --> 00:15:52,142
Nope. Osidius is right there.

226
00:15:52,143 --> 00:15:54,020
Swoop and cross.

227
00:15:54,062 --> 00:15:56,607
Shut the fuck up!

228
00:16:08,498 --> 00:16:10,333
Clementine.

229
00:16:10,668 --> 00:16:12,253
Cock-a-doodle-do.

230
00:16:15,132 --> 00:16:18,845
Hey. Hey.
Sorry to wake you,
but we're...

231
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:20,263
Here.

232
00:16:29,171 --> 00:16:31,570
Can I come over
to your house...

233
00:16:33,073 --> 00:16:34,908
To sleep?

234
00:16:34,908 --> 00:16:36,576
I'm so tired.

235
00:16:37,996 --> 00:16:39,915
Okay. Um, yeah.

236
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:42,460
Sure.
Let me get my toothbrush.
Yeah. Oh. Just--

237
00:17:05,783 --> 00:17:06,784
Yes?

238
00:17:07,535 --> 00:17:09,203
Can I help you?

239
00:17:09,454 --> 00:17:10,830
What do you mean?

240
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:13,835
Can I help you with something?

241
00:17:15,462 --> 00:17:16,797
No.

242
00:17:17,841 --> 00:17:19,343
What are you doing here?

243
00:17:19,384 --> 00:17:22,346
I'm not really sure
what you're asking me.

244
00:17:25,309 --> 00:17:26,644
Oh. Thanks.

245
00:18:07,449 --> 00:18:12,038
ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND

246
00:19:14,914 --> 00:19:16,708
We're looking for 1 59.

247
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:18,418
What number's that?

248
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,461
I don't know where that is.

249
00:19:19,461 --> 00:19:22,423
Jesus Christ, you'd think
they'd light the number,

250
00:19:22,465 --> 00:19:24,217
or at least put a number on--

251
00:19:24,259 --> 00:19:26,136
Is that him?
I think so.
Yeah, that's him.

252
00:19:27,305 --> 00:19:28,306
That's him.

253
00:19:43,577 --> 00:19:44,578
Hey, Joel.

254
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:45,996
Frank.

255
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,335
Oh, shit.

256
00:19:51,004 --> 00:19:54,675
Jesus. The only
Valentine's Day cards I get
are from my mother.

257
00:19:54,717 --> 00:19:56,344
How pathetic is that, huh?

258
00:19:57,137 --> 00:19:58,722
You're lucky
you have Clementine, man.

259
00:19:58,722 --> 00:20:00,724
She is way cool.

260
00:20:01,059 --> 00:20:03,812
Hey, you got any big
Valentine's Day plans with her?

261
00:20:07,609 --> 00:20:08,735
No.

262
00:20:08,777 --> 00:20:11,572
Well, it's only a day away.
Better make some reservations
or something.

263
00:20:11,614 --> 00:20:13,491
Don't want to end up
at Mickey D's. Right?

264
00:20:13,826 --> 00:20:15,745
McRomance!

265
00:20:15,912 --> 00:20:17,414
You want some fries
with that shake?

266
00:20:17,456 --> 00:20:21,002
I have to, uh,
go to sleep now, Frank.

267
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:23,379
But, is the 8:30.

268
00:20:51,501 --> 00:20:53,837
Patrick, stop it.

269
00:21:11,862 --> 00:21:13,489
Ohh! Okay.

270
00:21:14,532 --> 00:21:15,867
Okay. Okay.

271
00:21:20,957 --> 00:21:22,500
Showtime at the Apollo.

272
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,622
Hey, Joel. What's up?

273
00:21:53,042 --> 00:21:54,377
Oh. Hi, Frank.

274
00:22:00,218 --> 00:22:03,055
I only get Valentine's Day cards
from my mom.

275
00:22:03,138 --> 00:22:05,015
How pathetic is that?

276
00:22:05,975 --> 00:22:08,186
You're lucky
you have Clementine, Joel.

277
00:22:08,521 --> 00:22:12,442
Hey, you got, uh, any, uh, big
Valentine's Day plans with her?

278
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,403
No.

279
00:22:15,029 --> 00:22:18,450
It's only a day away.
Better make a reservation
or something.

280
00:22:18,701 --> 00:22:21,120
Don't wanna end up
at Mickey D's.

281
00:22:22,581 --> 00:22:24,416
Oh, no.!
Yes.! Valentine's Day

282
00:22:24,417 --> 00:22:27,421
is three goddamn days away.!
I want it resolved.

283
00:22:27,838 --> 00:22:29,632
I'm willing to be
the one to resolve it.

284
00:22:29,674 --> 00:22:30,800
So I call her,

285
00:22:30,842 --> 00:22:32,886
And she's changed her number.

286
00:22:33,387 --> 00:22:35,431
So I walked over to Antic Attic,
you know,

287
00:22:35,431 --> 00:22:36,682
to get her something.

288
00:22:36,725 --> 00:22:38,393
I thought I'd go over to work,

289
00:22:38,894 --> 00:22:41,731
give her an early valentine, and--

290
00:22:41,898 --> 00:22:43,400
You won't believe it.

291
00:22:44,318 --> 00:22:46,237
She's there with...

292
00:22:46,947 --> 00:22:50,034
This guy,
this really young guy.

293
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:54,457
And she looks at me like
she doesn't even know who I am.

294
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:56,126
Excuse me?

295
00:22:56,793 --> 00:22:58,837
Can I help you
find something, sir?

296
00:23:02,509 --> 00:23:06,305
Hey, Clem-ato.
Patrick!

297
00:23:06,348 --> 00:23:08,183
Baby boy.

298
00:23:11,772 --> 00:23:13,983
What you doing here, baby?
Just came to surprise you.

299
00:23:13,983 --> 00:23:15,818
Let me know
if you need something, sir.

300
00:23:16,486 --> 00:23:17,862
You look good.

301
00:23:18,823 --> 00:23:19,824
How are you?

302
00:23:19,866 --> 00:23:22,244
Pretty good.
Pretty bored. Pretty tired.

303
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,562
Why?
Why would she do that to me?

304
00:23:46,526 --> 00:23:48,445
Hey, does anybody want a joint?

305
00:23:49,071 --> 00:23:52,075
Oh, God, Rob, give it a rest.

306
00:23:52,117 --> 00:23:54,328
Oh, God.
She's punishing me.

307
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:56,539
I know, honey.
For being honest.
It's horrible.

308
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:58,417
I should just go to her house.
No.! No, no, no.

309
00:23:58,459 --> 00:23:59,919
You don't wanna go there, man.

310
00:23:59,961 --> 00:24:01,588
You don't wanna go there.
Get off.

311
00:24:02,464 --> 00:24:03,924
It's too-- Right.

312
00:24:04,092 --> 00:24:06,261
Yeah.
I don't want to seem desperate.

313
00:24:06,553 --> 00:24:08,639
Joel, why don't you just
see this as a sign,

314
00:24:08,973 --> 00:24:11,684
Make a clean break. Right?

315
00:24:16,483 --> 00:24:17,818
All right, Joel,

316
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:20,029
look, man, seriously.
Rob.!

317
00:24:20,071 --> 00:24:21,990
Here's the deal.
Don't do that.

318
00:24:22,032 --> 00:24:23,492
Rob, what are you doing?

319
00:24:23,534 --> 00:24:25,995
No, no, no, no.
What's your fucking suggestion, Carrie?

320
00:24:26,037 --> 00:24:28,331
What's your brilliant, reasoned solution?
You're gonna make this

321
00:24:28,374 --> 00:24:29,834
About our shit now?
This isn't about us.

322
00:24:29,876 --> 00:24:32,379
I agree. It's not about us.
It's about Joel,

323
00:24:32,421 --> 00:24:35,967
who's an adult.
Okay?
Not Mama Carrie's kid.

324
00:24:37,928 --> 00:24:39,012
- What are you--

325
00:24:42,017 --> 00:24:43,185
That's great.

326
00:24:43,227 --> 00:24:44,562
That's good.

327
00:24:56,537 --> 00:24:57,538
Okay.

328
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:59,749
"Clementine Kruczynski has had
Joel Barish erased from her memory.

329
00:24:59,791 --> 00:25:02,127
Please, never mention their
relationship to her again.

330
00:25:02,127 --> 00:25:04,087
Thank you.
Lacuna Inc.

331
00:25:04,422 --> 00:25:06,466
What is it?
I don't know.

332
00:25:06,592 --> 00:25:08,302
It's some place that does a thing.

333
00:25:21,236 --> 00:25:22,612
Good morning. Lacuna.

334
00:25:23,948 --> 00:25:27,452
No, I'm sorry.
That offer expired
after the new year.

335
00:25:29,622 --> 00:25:32,500
Yeah, sure.
We can fit you in--

336
00:25:32,501 --> 00:25:34,086
How about on the fifth?

337
00:25:35,005 --> 00:25:36,548
That's a Wednesday.

338
00:25:37,007 --> 00:25:38,842
All right, great.
Could you spell that, please?

339
00:25:39,844 --> 00:25:42,180
Okay, and we'll need
a daytime phone number.

340
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:45,727
Great. Have a nice day.

341
00:25:45,727 --> 00:25:46,853
See you then.

342
00:25:46,895 --> 00:25:48,480
May I help you?

343
00:25:48,523 --> 00:25:50,776
I'm Joel Barish.
Excuse me?

344
00:25:51,819 --> 00:25:53,738
I'm Joel. Barish.

345
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:56,700
I have an appointment with Dr.--
Mierzwiak.

346
00:25:57,493 --> 00:25:58,869
- Here. Could you please fill this out?

347
00:25:58,912 --> 00:26:00,080
- I just want to talk to him.

348
00:26:00,121 --> 00:26:02,040
You still need to
fill the form out, sir.

349
00:26:02,082 --> 00:26:03,709
Really?
- Thank you.
- Great.

350
00:26:06,463 --> 00:26:07,965
I don't have a pen.

351
00:26:08,007 --> 00:26:09,550
There's a pen right there.

352
00:26:11,387 --> 00:26:12,555
Good morning. Lacuna.
Oh.

353
00:26:13,055 --> 00:26:16,976
Oh, yeah, that offer. That's done now.
That expired after the new year.

354
00:26:17,019 --> 00:26:18,437
Mr. Barish?

355
00:26:21,442 --> 00:26:24,529
How are we today?
Not too good, actually.

356
00:26:25,614 --> 00:26:27,741
Boo.!
Oh, my God! Stan!

357
00:26:28,284 --> 00:26:30,453
Sorry.
Sorry, I was just--
I'm working!

358
00:26:30,495 --> 00:26:31,496
Sorry. Sorry.

359
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:35,836
Here, Doctor.
Thank you.

360
00:26:36,629 --> 00:26:38,506
You should not
have seen this.

361
00:26:38,548 --> 00:26:40,091
I apologize.

362
00:26:44,973 --> 00:26:47,226
This is a hoax, right?
I mean, this is Clem--

363
00:26:47,268 --> 00:26:48,644
I assure you, no.

364
00:26:48,686 --> 00:26:49,979
No.

365
00:26:56,697 --> 00:26:58,491
Mm-mmm.
There's no such thing as this.

366
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:03,038
Look, our files are confidential,
Mr. Barish,

367
00:27:03,081 --> 00:27:05,083
So I can't show you evidence.

368
00:27:05,417 --> 00:27:10,715
Suffice it to say that Miss, uh--
Miss Kruczynski was not happy,

369
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:13,427
And she wanted to move on.

370
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:16,056
We provide that possibility.

371
00:27:16,098 --> 00:27:17,474
''Miss Kruczynski was not happy

372
00:27:17,892 --> 00:27:19,727
And wanted to move on.

373
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:21,897
We provide
that possibility.''

374
00:27:23,191 --> 00:27:24,734
What the hell is that?

375
00:27:25,068 --> 00:27:27,321
Nicest guy
she ever went out with.

376
00:27:27,321 --> 00:27:28,739
Oww.! Fuck.!

377
00:27:29,741 --> 00:27:32,411
God, Rob! Give it a rest!

378
00:27:32,453 --> 00:27:34,580
It's okay. It's all right.
Carrie, I am making

379
00:27:34,623 --> 00:27:36,125
A birdhouse.

380
00:27:38,795 --> 00:27:42,299
What can I say, Joel?
You know Clementine. She's like that.

381
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,302
She's impulsive.

382
00:27:44,344 --> 00:27:47,681
She decided to erase you
almost as a lark.

383
00:27:51,896 --> 00:27:53,481
A lark.

384
00:28:00,491 --> 00:28:02,410
Wait, wait, wait, wait.!

385
00:28:02,452 --> 00:28:04,496
I'm sorry, Doctor.
He just barged right in here.

386
00:28:04,538 --> 00:28:05,539
Okay.

387
00:28:05,956 --> 00:28:08,501
I want it done. I told him
pre-Valentine's Day
is our busy time.

388
00:28:08,501 --> 00:28:10,503
- Oh, th-th-that's-- that's okay, Mary.

389
00:28:10,587 --> 00:28:11,880
- But there are people waiting.

390
00:28:11,922 --> 00:28:14,717
Mr. Barish, if you'd like to, uh--
to come inside.

391
00:28:14,801 --> 00:28:17,220
And, Mary, if you could take care of Mrs. Woo.
Yes, of course.

392
00:28:17,263 --> 00:28:18,556
Good-bye, Mrs. Woo.

393
00:28:22,895 --> 00:28:25,565
Now, the, uh--

394
00:28:25,649 --> 00:28:28,569
The first thing
we need you to do, Mr. Barish,

395
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:33,952
is to go home...
and collect everything you own
that has some association

396
00:28:33,994 --> 00:28:35,579
with Clementine.

397
00:28:36,163 --> 00:28:37,331
Anything.

398
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:43,256
And we'll use these
items to create a map

399
00:28:43,298 --> 00:28:45,717
of Clementine in your brain.
Okay?

400
00:28:46,177 --> 00:28:48,054
So we'll need, uh,

401
00:28:48,763 --> 00:28:51,516
uh, photos, clothing, gifts,

402
00:28:51,767 --> 00:28:54,020
books she may have bought you,

403
00:28:54,062 --> 00:28:56,273
CDs you may have bought together,

404
00:28:56,691 --> 00:28:58,276
journal entries.

405
00:28:58,985 --> 00:29:00,862
We want to empty your home--

406
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:03,491
We want to empty your life

407
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:04,700
of Clementine.

408
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:06,829
And after the mapping is done,

409
00:29:06,829 --> 00:29:09,999
our technicians will do the erasing
in your home tonight.

410
00:29:10,334 --> 00:29:13,171
That way, when you awake
in the morning,

411
00:29:13,672 --> 00:29:16,258
you'll find yourself in your own bed

412
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,511
as if nothing had happened--

413
00:29:18,553 --> 00:29:20,680
a new life awaiting you.

414
00:29:24,853 --> 00:29:26,188
Wake up, buddy!

415
00:29:32,029 --> 00:29:33,864
No, I'm sorry, Mrs. Sobel.

416
00:29:34,366 --> 00:29:37,578
You can't have the procedure done
three times in one month.

417
00:29:38,872 --> 00:29:40,582
Well, it's just not our policy--

418
00:29:40,666 --> 00:29:42,585
How are you today, Mr. Barish?

419
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:45,130
Hello. I'm right here.

420
00:29:45,798 --> 00:29:48,927
I know it's an emergency,
and we'll do everything we can--
We can fit you

421
00:29:48,927 --> 00:29:50,095
In on the first of March.

422
00:29:50,137 --> 00:29:52,807
Maybe you could talk to the doctor,
a-and he--

423
00:29:54,101 --> 00:29:55,811
All right, so let's make an appointment.

424
00:29:55,811 --> 00:29:57,980
What day would you like
to come in this week?

425
00:29:57,981 --> 00:30:01,193
Mr. Barish.
Um, he's really busy
this afternoon.

426
00:30:02,111 --> 00:30:05,490
Maybe tomorrow would be better.
Around 12:15? Can you do that?

427
00:30:06,659 --> 00:30:09,621
February is very busy for us
because of Valentine's Day.

428
00:30:16,464 --> 00:30:21,303
This is, uh, Stan Fink,
one of our most experienced
and skilled technicians.

429
00:30:23,014 --> 00:30:25,475
He'll be handling
your case tonight.

430
00:30:25,518 --> 00:30:27,186
Great to meet you,

431
00:30:28,355 --> 00:30:29,857
My name is Joel Barish,

432
00:30:29,857 --> 00:30:34,237
And I'm here to erase
Clementine Kruczynski.

433
00:30:35,197 --> 00:30:37,825
Very good.
Now, tell me about,

434
00:30:38,243 --> 00:30:40,078
Uh, Clementine.

435
00:30:40,538 --> 00:30:42,957
Uh, I was...

436
00:30:42,958 --> 00:30:44,918
Living with this woman,

437
00:30:45,461 --> 00:30:46,712
Naomi,

438
00:30:47,881 --> 00:30:49,216
Uh, a couple years ago,

439
00:30:49,383 --> 00:30:53,179
And my friends Rob and Carrie
invited us to this party at the beach--

440
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:54,556
I don't like parties.

441
00:30:54,598 --> 00:30:56,558
Naomi couldn't go, but

442
00:30:56,601 --> 00:30:59,229
I went...
and I, uh,

443
00:30:59,646 --> 00:31:01,398
met Clementine.

444
00:31:02,901 --> 00:31:04,236
I'm sorry.

445
00:31:04,278 --> 00:31:08,241
Let's start with
your most recent memories... and

446
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:10,160
Work backwards from there,
more or less.

447
00:31:11,287 --> 00:31:14,082
There's an emotional core...
to each of our memories,

448
00:31:14,124 --> 00:31:16,335
And when you eradicate that core

449
00:31:16,335 --> 00:31:19,005
It starts its degradation process.

450
00:31:19,256 --> 00:31:20,799
By the time you wake up
in the morning,

451
00:31:20,841 --> 00:31:24,387
All the memories we've targeted
will have withered and disappeared,

452
00:31:25,181 --> 00:31:27,350
As in a dream upon waking.

453
00:31:27,559 --> 00:31:30,104
Is there any risk
of brain damage?

454
00:31:30,563 --> 00:31:33,608
Well, uh, technically speaking,

455
00:31:33,609 --> 00:31:35,611
The procedure is brain damage,
but

456
00:31:35,611 --> 00:31:38,656
It's on a par with
a night of heavy drinking.

457
00:31:39,324 --> 00:31:41,034
Nothing you'll miss.

458
00:31:42,328 --> 00:31:44,038
Comfortable?

459
00:31:44,331 --> 00:31:46,417
What we're doing here, Mr. Barish,

460
00:31:46,417 --> 00:31:49,045
Is actually creating a map of your brain.

461
00:31:49,046 --> 00:31:50,881
Okay, let's get started.

462
00:31:50,882 --> 00:31:52,717
If we want to get
this procedure underway tonight,

463
00:31:52,717 --> 00:31:54,427
we have some work to do.

464
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,431
I want you to react
to these objects, Mr. Barish,

465
00:31:57,432 --> 00:31:59,392
If you will.

466
00:32:02,021 --> 00:32:04,732
There's a good story
behind this one--
Uh, actually, Mr. Barish,

467
00:32:04,775 --> 00:32:09,155
I'll get a much better
emotional readout...
if you refrain from any sort of

468
00:32:09,156 --> 00:32:10,866
Verbal description of the items.

469
00:32:10,908 --> 00:32:12,743
Just try to focus on the memories.

470
00:32:12,911 --> 00:32:14,371
Oh. Sorry. Okay.

471
00:32:17,208 --> 00:32:20,253
Healthy activity up there again.
Healthy readouts.

472
00:32:20,254 --> 00:32:21,505
Very good.

473
00:32:21,923 --> 00:32:23,216
- Here's another object.
That's so--

474
00:32:24,426 --> 00:32:25,969
Next item.

475
00:32:26,429 --> 00:32:27,847
Okay.

476
00:32:29,266 --> 00:32:31,226
Potato head.

477
00:32:31,311 --> 00:32:33,146
- Next item.

478
00:32:35,191 --> 00:32:36,859
Just focus on the memories.

479
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:39,613
Patrick, do me a favor.

480
00:32:40,364 --> 00:32:42,450
Hey, Patrick,
do me a favor, will ya?

481
00:32:42,826 --> 00:32:45,704
Can you check the voltage regulator?
Yeah.

482
00:32:45,997 --> 00:32:48,166
What do we got there?
Uh, voltage looks fine.

483
00:32:48,417 --> 00:32:50,836
Really?
Well, I'm not wiping
as clean

484
00:32:50,878 --> 00:32:52,505
As I like here.

485
00:33:03,228 --> 00:33:05,898
Check the, uh--
Check the connections, please.

486
00:33:07,526 --> 00:33:09,528
Oh, there you are.
I--

487
00:33:15,328 --> 00:33:17,038
Why am I--

488
00:33:17,581 --> 00:33:19,583
I don't understand
what I'm looking at.

489
00:33:19,625 --> 00:33:21,127
Why am I

490
00:33:21,169 --> 00:33:22,629
Standing here and--

491
00:33:22,629 --> 00:33:24,589
Oh, my God.
Déjà vu.

492
00:33:25,258 --> 00:33:26,760
Déjà vu.

493
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:30,097
This is so--
All right, we should get started.

494
00:33:30,139 --> 00:33:33,059
If we're gonna get the procedure...
underway tonight, we have some work to do.

495
00:33:33,435 --> 00:33:35,187
I'm in my head already,
aren't I?

496
00:33:36,064 --> 00:33:37,524
I suppose so. Uh,

497
00:33:38,275 --> 00:33:40,778
This is about right.

498
00:33:40,945 --> 00:33:42,780
This is what it--
This is what it would look like.

499
00:33:44,909 --> 00:33:46,536
Very good.

500
00:33:46,953 --> 00:33:49,498
We'll dispose of these mementos
when we're done here.

501
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:51,292
That way you won't be confused later by

502
00:33:51,334 --> 00:33:53,837
Their unexplainable presence in your home.
Ah, there we go.

503
00:33:55,173 --> 00:33:56,841
Patrick?
Yeah?

504
00:33:58,010 --> 00:33:59,678
Patrick, can you check--
Patrick,

505
00:34:00,179 --> 00:34:01,889
I'm getting some sort of readout
of my own voice.
Patrick?

506
00:34:02,182 --> 00:34:04,935
- Patrick?
- Why are there so many wires?
-A lot of equipment.

507
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:07,898
- Does that help?

508
00:34:11,528 --> 00:34:14,073
How's that?
How are you today,
Mr. Barish?

509
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:16,701
- I don't know if I like this.

510
00:34:16,743 --> 00:34:18,036
- Think I might try this, then.

511
00:34:18,537 --> 00:34:19,788
We're almost done now.

512
00:34:19,789 --> 00:34:21,332
Mmm. Journal.

513
00:34:21,333 --> 00:34:22,709
That would be invaluable.

514
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:25,796
''I met someone tonight.

515
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:28,592
I don't know what to do.
Her name is Clementine,

516
00:34:28,634 --> 00:34:30,594
and she's amazing. ''

517
00:34:31,054 --> 00:34:33,056
- Whoa! Jesus!
What? What?

518
00:34:33,098 --> 00:34:34,141
Come on! Careful!

519
00:34:34,183 --> 00:34:35,643
Step back!

520
00:34:35,935 --> 00:34:37,437
Just take it easy.

521
00:34:38,439 --> 00:34:39,440
That's fine.

522
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,651
Let's not roach the guy.

523
00:34:45,782 --> 00:34:47,242
All right, you got that one.

524
00:34:47,284 --> 00:34:49,119
This place is sort of a dump,
don't you think?

525
00:34:49,161 --> 00:34:51,121
It's an apartment, Patrick.

526
00:34:53,459 --> 00:34:56,045
Well, not a dump, then,
but sorta plain.

527
00:34:56,087 --> 00:34:57,630
Uninspired.

528
00:34:58,006 --> 00:35:00,467
And there's sort of
a stale smell.

529
00:35:00,927 --> 00:35:02,053
Patrick,

530
00:35:02,095 --> 00:35:03,221
can we just

531
00:35:03,222 --> 00:35:06,810
please get through this?
We got a very long night
ahead of us.

532
00:35:06,852 --> 00:35:08,312
Yeah. Yeah.
Come on.

533
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:15,530
This is the last time I saw you.

534
00:35:31,551 --> 00:35:33,053
It's 3:00.

535
00:35:33,095 --> 00:35:37,809
I kinda sorta wrecked your car.

536
00:35:37,810 --> 00:35:40,647
Were you driving drunk?
It's pathetic.

537
00:35:42,149 --> 00:35:44,694
I was a little tipsy.

538
00:35:44,902 --> 00:35:46,237
Don't call me pathetic.

539
00:35:46,279 --> 00:35:47,739
Well, it is pathetic.

540
00:35:47,781 --> 00:35:49,324
It's fucking irresponsible.

541
00:35:49,367 --> 00:35:51,244
Could've killed somebody.
Oh, God.

542
00:35:51,286 --> 00:35:54,415
Maybe you did kill somebody.
Should we turn on the news and see?

543
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:57,627
Oh, Christ.!
Should I check the grill to see
if there's any children or

544
00:35:57,628 --> 00:35:59,797
small animals?
It's just a fucking dent, Joel.

545
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:01,299
You're like an old lady or something.

546
00:36:01,299 --> 00:36:03,093
Well, what are you like?

547
00:36:04,345 --> 00:36:06,347
A wino?
A wino?

548
00:36:06,348 --> 00:36:09,352
Jesus, are you from the '50s
or something?

549
00:36:09,393 --> 00:36:10,978
A wino?

550
00:36:12,189 --> 00:36:14,984
Face it, Joely.
You're freaked out because

551
00:36:15,026 --> 00:36:17,696
I was out late without you,

552
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:20,408
And in your little wormy brain...

553
00:36:20,825 --> 00:36:22,660
You're trying to figure out,

554
00:36:22,745 --> 00:36:24,998
Did she fuck someone tonight?

555
00:36:26,583 --> 00:36:28,126
No, see, Clem,

556
00:36:28,335 --> 00:36:30,713
I assume you fucked
someone tonight.

557
00:36:31,465 --> 00:36:34,093
Isn't that how you get people
to like you?

558
00:36:44,732 --> 00:36:46,567
I'm sorry. Okay?

559
00:36:47,236 --> 00:36:49,405
Clem, I didn't mean it.
All right?

560
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:57,248
Clem?
Your keys.

561
00:36:57,291 --> 00:36:59,418
I was just--
I won't need them anymore.
I was just--

562
00:37:00,754 --> 00:37:03,424
Angry or annoyed or something,
I don't know.

563
00:37:10,934 --> 00:37:12,102
Clem?

564
00:37:14,606 --> 00:37:15,649
Got it.

565
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:19,821
Mary's coming over tonight.
Yeah?

566
00:37:19,863 --> 00:37:21,990
Yeah.
Just thought you'd wanna know.

567
00:37:22,449 --> 00:37:23,658
I like Mary.

568
00:37:23,659 --> 00:37:26,162
I like when she comes to visit.
I just don't think she likes me.

569
00:37:26,163 --> 00:37:27,665
She likes you okay.

570
00:37:28,666 --> 00:37:31,544
Maybe I should invite my girlfriend over.

571
00:37:31,545 --> 00:37:34,006
I have a girlfriend now.
Do whatever you want.

572
00:37:34,215 --> 00:37:36,509
Did I tell you I have--
Yeah.

573
00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:43,518
Did I tell you I have--
I have a girlfriend ?

574
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:45,563
We gotta focus here, Patrick.

575
00:37:46,523 --> 00:37:47,899
Yeah, the thing is,

576
00:37:47,983 --> 00:37:49,651
Our situation is--

577
00:37:50,487 --> 00:37:52,197
Is a little weird.

578
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:53,866
My girlfriend situation.

579
00:37:53,992 --> 00:37:55,535
I'm sure it is.

580
00:37:56,203 --> 00:37:57,746
You gotta be--

581
00:38:23,698 --> 00:38:25,408
Clem, let me drive you home.

582
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:27,953
Get out of my face, faggot.!

583
00:38:29,122 --> 00:38:30,624
Look at it out here.!

584
00:38:30,665 --> 00:38:32,292
It's all falling apart.!

585
00:38:33,085 --> 00:38:35,296
I'm erasing you, and I'm happy!

586
00:38:35,338 --> 00:38:37,507
You did it to me first!

587
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:39,636
I can't believe
you did this to me.

588
00:38:41,597 --> 00:38:43,808
Clem! Can you hear me?

589
00:38:44,184 --> 00:38:46,687
By morning you'll be gone!

590
00:38:46,854 --> 00:38:50,358
The perfect ending
to this piece-of-shit story!

591
00:38:55,866 --> 00:38:58,536
with a girl being attracted to me?

592
00:38:58,578 --> 00:39:01,832
Is that a problem?
No, I think it's... funny.

593
00:39:02,208 --> 00:39:04,043
So, who do you think's better-looking,

594
00:39:04,085 --> 00:39:05,378
me or this guy?

595
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:07,214
Patrick, let's focus, buddy.

596
00:39:07,339 --> 00:39:09,341
Remember that girl
we did last week?

597
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:12,596
The one with the... potatoes?

598
00:39:15,058 --> 00:39:16,434
That girl?

599
00:39:16,477 --> 00:39:18,229
That's this guy's girl.

600
00:39:18,646 --> 00:39:20,064
Friend.

601
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:21,901
Was. We

602
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:24,570
took care of that.

603
00:39:24,613 --> 00:39:26,115
Well, uh...

604
00:39:26,448 --> 00:39:28,617
I kinda fell in love with her
that night.

605
00:39:28,952 --> 00:39:32,790
What? You little fuck--
What?

606
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:34,792
She was unconscious, man.

607
00:39:35,502 --> 00:39:37,796
Well, she was beautiful, and...

608
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,800
I stole a pair of her panties
as well.

609
00:39:44,222 --> 00:39:47,142
Jesus! What?
It's not like--

610
00:39:47,184 --> 00:39:48,352
I mean, they were clean and all.

611
00:39:48,394 --> 00:39:50,772
Don't tell me this stuff, man!
I don't wanna hear this shit!

612
00:39:50,772 --> 00:39:53,400
They were clean.!
What? D-Don't.! Stop.!

613
00:39:53,443 --> 00:39:55,487
Okay. Yeah.! All right.!

614
00:39:55,487 --> 00:39:56,738
Okay.
Fine

615
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:58,490
Give me my papers.

616
00:40:18,893 --> 00:40:21,229
After we did her, I kind of...

617
00:40:27,655 --> 00:40:29,365
Jesus.
Jesus, Patrick.!

618
00:40:35,249 --> 00:40:37,585
How unethical-- It's

619
00:40:37,627 --> 00:40:39,379
Not really that bad.

620
00:40:39,755 --> 00:40:42,508
What? Get that look off your face.
What's wrong?

621
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:45,762
Patrick, you stole a girl's panties.!

622
00:40:57,653 --> 00:40:59,196
There's someone here.

623
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,160
He stole your underwear.

624
00:41:03,369 --> 00:41:04,829
I don't see anyone.

625
00:41:24,022 --> 00:41:25,023
Joel?

626
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:27,025
Where are my boots?

627
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:46,760
I'm fucking crawling
out of my skin!

628
00:41:48,763 --> 00:41:51,099
Should've left you
at the flea market.

629
00:42:04,451 --> 00:42:05,953
Wanna go?

630
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:09,416
I want to have a baby.

631
00:42:10,459 --> 00:42:12,419
Let's talk about it later.

632
00:42:12,462 --> 00:42:15,007
No! I want to have a baby.

633
00:42:16,509 --> 00:42:18,219
I don't think we're ready.

634
00:42:19,221 --> 00:42:20,848
You're not ready.

635
00:42:22,517 --> 00:42:24,853
Clem, do you really think
you could take care of a kid?

636
00:42:25,521 --> 00:42:27,356
Devils, What?

637
00:42:29,192 --> 00:42:30,902
I don't wanna
talk about it here.

638
00:42:30,945 --> 00:42:33,865
I can't hear you.
I can never the fuck understand
what you're saying.

639
00:42:33,907 --> 00:42:35,534
I don't wanna talk about this!
Fucking ventriloquist!

640
00:42:36,077 --> 00:42:38,204
We're fucking
gonna talk about it!
I... don't...

641
00:42:38,246 --> 00:42:40,206
Want... to--
You can't just say something like that

642
00:42:40,249 --> 00:42:42,209
And say you don't wanna talk about it!
I'm sorry, Clem.

643
00:42:42,251 --> 00:42:45,129
I'd make a fucking good mother!
I love children,

644
00:42:45,172 --> 00:42:48,885
I'm creative and smart,
and I'd make a fucking great mother!
Oh, God-- Mmm!

645
00:42:49,219 --> 00:42:52,556
It's you, Joel. It's you
who can't commit to anything!

646
00:42:52,599 --> 00:42:55,477
It's going! It's going!
You have no idea how lucky you are
I'm interested in you!

647
00:42:55,519 --> 00:42:58,439
Maybe I should end this
right here, Joel!

648
00:42:58,648 --> 00:43:02,486
Leave you at the flea market
with this stupid costume jewelry!
It's done. This is crap.

649
00:43:02,779 --> 00:43:06,492
Maybe you could find yourself
an antique rocking chair to die in!
All the pain, confusion--

650
00:43:15,462 --> 00:43:17,297
Oh. Hi, Patrick.
Hi, Mary. How's it goin'?

651
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:19,050
Hey, you.
Oh, it's freezing outside.

652
00:43:19,468 --> 00:43:21,804
Find us okay?
Yeah.

653
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:30,816
Poor guy.

654
00:43:33,987 --> 00:43:37,783
Don't you have
anything real to drink?
Uh, we haven't really

655
00:43:37,826 --> 00:43:40,037
checked yet.
Patrick?

656
00:43:40,037 --> 00:43:41,372
Uh, yeah.

657
00:43:41,372 --> 00:43:43,207
Uh, let me do the honors.

658
00:43:44,877 --> 00:43:46,545
Mary hates me.

659
00:43:46,713 --> 00:43:48,715
Never really had much luck
with the ladies.

660
00:43:48,757 --> 00:43:51,385
Maybe if you stop
stealing their panties.

661
00:43:52,887 --> 00:43:56,850
Stan. Stan.
There's more.
No! Yes. No!

662
00:44:01,733 --> 00:44:03,777
Oh, you didn't want any,
did you, Patrick?

663
00:44:03,819 --> 00:44:05,863
Uh, no, that's okay.
Wait.

664
00:44:07,198 --> 00:44:09,576
''Blessed are the forgetful,
for they get the better

665
00:44:09,618 --> 00:44:11,412
Even of their blunders.''

666
00:44:22,469 --> 00:44:24,054
That's Nietzsche.

667
00:44:24,221 --> 00:44:27,308
Beyond Good and Evil.
I found it in my Bartlett's.

668
00:44:27,809 --> 00:44:29,519
What's your Bartlett's?

669
00:44:30,187 --> 00:44:31,814
It's a quote book, Patrick.

670
00:44:31,856 --> 00:44:34,150
It's a book of quotations.

671
00:44:34,151 --> 00:44:36,487
I think Howard
will be in Bartlett's
one day.

672
00:44:36,529 --> 00:44:38,823
Definitely.
Howard is pure Bartlett's.

673
00:44:42,495 --> 00:44:44,330
Can you wake him up?
-No

674
00:44:44,373 --> 00:44:46,167
You can't wake him up.

675
00:44:54,511 --> 00:44:56,722
You don't tell me things, Joel.

676
00:44:58,392 --> 00:45:00,227
I'm an open book.

677
00:45:01,729 --> 00:45:03,731
I tell you everything.

678
00:45:09,573 --> 00:45:11,617
You don't trust me.

679
00:45:12,077 --> 00:45:15,498
Constantly talking
isn't necessarily communicating.

680
00:45:17,918 --> 00:45:19,586
I don't do that.

681
00:45:22,257 --> 00:45:24,426
I want to know you.

682
00:45:27,138 --> 00:45:29,224
I don't constantly talk.

683
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:30,935
Jesus!

684
00:45:32,604 --> 00:45:35,399
People have to
share things, Joel.
Mm-hmm.

685
00:45:36,526 --> 00:45:38,653
That's what intimacy is.

686
00:45:39,572 --> 00:45:41,866
I'm really pissed
that you said that to me.

687
00:45:41,908 --> 00:45:43,368
I'm sorry.

688
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:46,956
It just-- really just
isn't that interesting.

689
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,045
I wanna read some of those journals
you're constantly scribbling in.

690
00:45:51,087 --> 00:45:54,675
What do you write in there
if you don't have any thoughts
or passions or...

691
00:45:55,051 --> 00:45:56,344
love?

692
00:46:03,353 --> 00:46:07,358
November 19, 2003.

693
00:46:08,110 --> 00:46:10,696
Dinner at Kang's again.

694
00:46:12,699 --> 00:46:15,369
Are we like those poor couples...

695
00:46:16,287 --> 00:46:18,540
you feel sorry for in restaurants?

696
00:46:19,083 --> 00:46:20,793
Are we the dining dead?

697
00:46:21,711 --> 00:46:25,424
I can't stand the idea of us being
a couple people think that about.

698
00:46:34,770 --> 00:46:36,105
How's the chicken?

699
00:46:37,149 --> 00:46:38,525
Good.

700
00:46:39,777 --> 00:46:42,530
More?
No. No. Thank you.

701
00:46:45,451 --> 00:46:47,787
She's gonna be drunk
and stupid now.

702
00:46:48,288 --> 00:46:50,582
Hey, would you
do me a favor...

703
00:46:50,583 --> 00:46:53,545
And clean the goddamn hair off the soap
when you're done in the shower?

704
00:46:53,587 --> 00:46:55,005
Yeah. Oh. Yeah.
It's really...

705
00:46:55,715 --> 00:46:57,467
- Gross.
- gross.

706
00:46:59,971 --> 00:47:01,306
- It's just--

707
00:47:01,473 --> 00:47:03,809
- Repulsive.
It's repulsive.

708
00:47:10,026 --> 00:47:11,861
Patrick, can we get through this?

709
00:47:12,529 --> 00:47:13,822
Patrick...

710
00:47:16,868 --> 00:47:18,203
Patrick...

711
00:47:19,789 --> 00:47:21,791
I'm so miserable right now.

712
00:47:22,542 --> 00:47:23,710
Why? What's wrong?

713
00:47:23,752 --> 00:47:26,922
I don't know.
I'm so confused.!

714
00:47:27,215 --> 00:47:28,550
Can I help you
find something, sir?

715
00:47:28,592 --> 00:47:31,888
Confused? What are you confused about?
Everything's fine.

716
00:47:40,733 --> 00:47:43,236
Do you love me?
Of course I do.

717
00:47:43,571 --> 00:47:45,490
Where's the self-help section?

718
00:47:46,575 --> 00:47:49,996
Do you think I'm ugly?
No.! You're beautiful.!

719
00:47:50,204 --> 00:47:52,665
Maybe I should come over.
No, no.

720
00:47:52,833 --> 00:47:56,295
I don't know.
I-I'm a mess, Patrick.

721
00:47:56,338 --> 00:47:57,172
No...

722
00:47:57,214 --> 00:47:59,508
Well, just let me come over.
I'll cheer you up.

723
00:47:59,675 --> 00:48:00,843
Okay.

724
00:48:00,885 --> 00:48:02,512
Stan, can I leave for a while?

725
00:48:02,805 --> 00:48:04,765
My girlfriend's really upset.
Patrick...

726
00:48:05,099 --> 00:48:08,395
We're right in the middle
of erasing this poor man's--
Let him go, Stan!

727
00:48:08,646 --> 00:48:10,314
Let him go. I'll help.

728
00:48:11,608 --> 00:48:15,279
See? How hard can it be?
- She hates me.
She wants me to go. - Go.

729
00:48:18,117 --> 00:48:19,827
I'll be right over, Tangerine.

730
00:48:19,994 --> 00:48:21,162
You like?

731
00:48:25,001 --> 00:48:27,212
Oh, man!
I matched my sweatshirt exactly.

732
00:48:27,254 --> 00:48:28,672
I like it.
You do?

733
00:48:28,714 --> 00:48:30,800
You look like a tangerine.
Ohh!

734
00:48:31,301 --> 00:48:34,138
''Clemen-teen'' the tangerine.

735
00:48:34,222 --> 00:48:35,974
Mmm! Juicy!
And seedless.

736
00:48:36,141 --> 00:48:37,517
I like that.

737
00:48:39,103 --> 00:48:42,023
I like tangerines!

738
00:48:42,065 --> 00:48:43,149
Can you see me doing ducks?

739
00:48:43,275 --> 00:48:44,735
Tangerine.
Joel.

740
00:48:44,736 --> 00:48:46,321
Ducks.
Quack-quack.

741
00:48:46,488 --> 00:48:47,990
How does he know
to call you that?

742
00:48:47,990 --> 00:48:49,533
How did who know?

743
00:48:49,575 --> 00:48:51,202
Oh, my God.

744
00:48:51,244 --> 00:48:52,328
Clem?

745
00:48:52,329 --> 00:48:54,748
That's what
they called themselves.
The Clash--

746
00:48:54,791 --> 00:48:58,754
The only band that mattered.
They called themselves that
for a reason.

747
00:48:58,796 --> 00:49:00,756
It's amazing, isn't it?
Like social justice--

748
00:49:00,757 --> 00:49:04,678
Yeah, it's totally incredible.
What Howard
gives to the world.

749
00:49:06,389 --> 00:49:07,765
Yeah.

750
00:49:08,058 --> 00:49:10,853
To let people begin again.

751
00:49:12,564 --> 00:49:16,402
It's beautiful.
You look at a baby,
and it's so pure

752
00:49:16,445 --> 00:49:20,200
And so free
and so clean.
And...

753
00:49:20,325 --> 00:49:23,662
Adults are, like,
this mess of sadness...
and...

754
00:49:25,081 --> 00:49:26,666
Phobias.

755
00:49:26,875 --> 00:49:29,169
And Howard just makes it all go away.

756
00:49:42,688 --> 00:49:44,690
Baby, what's going on?
I don't know.

757
00:49:44,732 --> 00:49:47,527
I don't know!
I'm lost, I'm scared,

758
00:49:47,945 --> 00:49:49,530
I feel like I'm disappearing.

759
00:49:49,572 --> 00:49:52,242
My skin's coming off!.
I'm getting old!

760
00:49:52,242 --> 00:49:55,079
Nothing makes any sense to me!
You're not getting old.

761
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:56,915
Nothing makes any sense.

762
00:49:56,915 --> 00:49:59,251
Nothing makes any sense.
Ohh,

763
00:49:59,252 --> 00:50:00,754
Tangerine.
Nothing makes any sense.

764
00:50:01,755 --> 00:50:03,257
Nothing makes any sense.

765
00:50:03,299 --> 00:50:05,259
Patrick.
It's okay. It's okay.

766
00:50:05,301 --> 00:50:07,011
Hey, let's go out dancing.

767
00:50:07,054 --> 00:50:10,058
Yeah?
You wanna go out to Montauk with me?

768
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:11,810
Montauk?
Yeah. No!

769
00:50:12,102 --> 00:50:15,106
Come up to Boston with me.
Sure. Yeah.
We can go next weekend.

770
00:50:15,148 --> 00:50:17,108
No, no. Now. Now.

771
00:50:17,151 --> 00:50:21,281
Yeah. I have to go now.
I have to see
the frozen Charles now.

772
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:26,705
Hi, it's Joel.

773
00:50:28,207 --> 00:50:30,460
Um, leave a message after the beep

774
00:50:31,211 --> 00:50:33,338
and I'll get back to you.

775
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:36,342
Pick up.! Pick up, man.!
W-W-W-W-Whoa.

776
00:50:41,850 --> 00:50:43,185
Hello?

777
00:50:43,519 --> 00:50:44,687
Yeah, what's up?

778
00:50:44,771 --> 00:50:47,024
I got into a little situation
with the old lady.

779
00:50:47,525 --> 00:50:49,068
Can you handle things tonight alone?

780
00:50:49,110 --> 00:50:50,528
I'm really sorry, man.

781
00:50:50,570 --> 00:50:53,031
Don't worry about it.
I got it under control, man.

782
00:50:53,074 --> 00:50:55,243
He's pretty much on autopilot
right now anyway.

783
00:50:55,285 --> 00:50:56,870
Thanks, Stan. I owe you big-time.

784
00:50:56,912 --> 00:50:58,706
Dude, I gotta go.
I gotta go.

785
00:51:12,266 --> 00:51:14,560
''Look! You and me on the Charles River.

786
00:51:14,769 --> 00:51:16,563
I could die right now, Clem.

787
00:51:16,605 --> 00:51:18,190
I'm just happy.

788
00:51:18,232 --> 00:51:21,110
I've never felt that before.
I'm just exactly where I want--''

789
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:24,115
I'm so excited.

790
00:51:24,449 --> 00:51:26,117
Yea.
I'm excited too.!

791
00:51:26,159 --> 00:51:27,494
Cool.
Oh, uh,

792
00:51:29,289 --> 00:51:30,457
I, uh--

793
00:51:30,624 --> 00:51:32,334
I got you this...

794
00:51:33,670 --> 00:51:34,671
Thing, um--

795
00:51:35,547 --> 00:51:37,800
Happy early Valentine's Day.

796
00:51:42,515 --> 00:51:43,891
What is it?

797
00:51:43,933 --> 00:51:45,810
Uh, I don't know.
Open it up.

798
00:51:53,655 --> 00:51:55,532
It-- It's gorgeous!
- You like it?

799
00:51:55,574 --> 00:51:57,576
- Yeah. It's just my taste. Really.

800
00:51:57,868 --> 00:52:01,205
I've never gone out with a guy
who bought me a piece of jewelry I liked.

801
00:52:02,208 --> 00:52:03,543
Thank you.

802
00:52:13,055 --> 00:52:14,974
Okay. Joely?

803
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:16,393
Yeah, Tangerine?

804
00:52:17,937 --> 00:52:19,731
Am I ugly?

805
00:52:22,067 --> 00:52:23,986
When I was a kid,
I thought I was.

806
00:52:25,822 --> 00:52:28,116
Can't believe I'm crying already.

807
00:52:28,785 --> 00:52:30,579
Sometimes I think people

808
00:52:30,621 --> 00:52:33,416
don't understand how lonely it is
to be a kid.

809
00:52:34,501 --> 00:52:37,087
Like you don't

810
00:52:37,088 --> 00:52:38,631
matter. So,

811
00:52:39,090 --> 00:52:43,137
I'm eight...
and I have these toys,

812
00:52:43,137 --> 00:52:44,889
these dolls.

813
00:52:45,015 --> 00:52:48,019
My favorite is this ugly girl doll

814
00:52:48,061 --> 00:52:49,646
who I call Clementine.

815
00:52:49,896 --> 00:52:51,898
And I keep yelling at her.:

816
00:52:51,982 --> 00:52:55,611
''You can't be ugly! Be pretty!''

817
00:52:56,322 --> 00:52:57,657
It's weird.

818
00:52:57,698 --> 00:52:59,992
Like if I can transform her,

819
00:53:01,328 --> 00:53:03,539
I would magically change too.

820
00:53:08,838 --> 00:53:10,173
You're pretty.

821
00:53:10,215 --> 00:53:11,925
Joely,

822
00:53:12,677 --> 00:53:16,598
Don't ever leave me.
Pretty. Pretty.

823
00:53:17,433 --> 00:53:19,393
Pretty. Pretty.
Mierzwiak,

824
00:53:19,811 --> 00:53:22,147
please let me keep this memory.

825
00:53:22,189 --> 00:53:24,066
Just this one.

826
00:53:24,067 --> 00:53:25,986
I don't wanna hold your hand.
Come on.

827
00:53:30,576 --> 00:53:31,660
Whoa!
Stop it!

828
00:53:34,205 --> 00:53:36,499
I could die right now, Clem.

829
00:53:38,837 --> 00:53:40,797
I'm just...

830
00:53:41,590 --> 00:53:43,509
Happy.

831
00:53:46,222 --> 00:53:48,433
I've never felt that before.

832
00:53:51,771 --> 00:53:53,773
I'm just exactly...

833
00:53:56,569 --> 00:53:58,655
Where I wanna be.

834
00:54:00,449 --> 00:54:01,784
Clem?

835
00:54:07,834 --> 00:54:09,085
I wanna call it off.

836
00:54:09,836 --> 00:54:11,755
I'll give you a sign.

837
00:54:16,846 --> 00:54:18,848
I wanna call it off!.

838
00:54:20,726 --> 00:54:24,981
Can you hear me?
I don't want this anymore!
I wanna call it off!.

839
00:54:31,866 --> 00:54:35,412
Is anybody there?

840
00:54:42,422 --> 00:54:43,757
Clementine?

841
00:54:46,093 --> 00:54:47,261
Joely?

842
00:54:47,261 --> 00:54:49,263
Clement--
Joel?

843
00:54:49,264 --> 00:54:50,599
Clem!

844
00:54:52,226 --> 00:54:53,644
What?
We gotta go.

845
00:54:54,020 --> 00:54:55,271
We gotta go.
What? Where?

846
00:54:55,314 --> 00:54:57,108
I have an idea
of how to stop this.

847
00:54:57,150 --> 00:54:58,276
Stop what?

848
00:54:59,486 --> 00:55:01,446
Joely.
Come on,

849
00:55:08,623 --> 00:55:10,458
No!
Concentrate, Clem.

850
00:55:14,297 --> 00:55:15,632
There was a tape recorder.

851
00:55:15,674 --> 00:55:16,842
No,

852
00:55:16,884 --> 00:55:18,135
not the picture.
Not the picture.

853
00:55:20,306 --> 00:55:21,974
Back here.
Come on!

854
00:55:22,517 --> 00:55:25,020
Oh, look at me.
Hey, I look good there.

855
00:55:25,312 --> 00:55:28,023
Look, our files are confidential,

856
00:55:28,066 --> 00:55:30,110
Mr. Barish,
so I can't show you evidence.

857
00:55:30,444 --> 00:55:33,030
Suffiice it to say that Miss, uh--

858
00:55:33,031 --> 00:55:36,535
Miss Kruczynski...
was not happy

859
00:55:36,577 --> 00:55:38,037
and she wanted to move on.

860
00:55:38,538 --> 00:55:40,373
Good. Now,

861
00:55:40,416 --> 00:55:42,210
tell me about

862
00:55:42,544 --> 00:55:43,962
Clementine.

863
00:55:43,962 --> 00:55:45,714
That's what he said. Then--
What did we see that day?

864
00:55:45,756 --> 00:55:47,550
No, wait.
Oh,

865
00:55:47,592 --> 00:55:49,803
Look! Hey! Shit!
We're going to see
my grandma.

866
00:55:50,304 --> 00:55:52,139
Joel, why-- No, I don't want to--

867
00:55:52,181 --> 00:55:54,392
Joel, please!
We're not going on a train.

868
00:55:54,434 --> 00:55:55,685
Don't make me run anymore.
Come on!

869
00:55:56,062 --> 00:55:57,522
Mierzwiak!

870
00:55:58,398 --> 00:56:00,525
Do we always have to run?
Mierzwiak!

871
00:56:10,956 --> 00:56:12,291
Please.

872
00:56:12,792 --> 00:56:15,128
So, why don't we

873
00:56:15,170 --> 00:56:18,841
Begin by you telling me...
everything you can remember.
Mierzwiak.!

874
00:56:19,259 --> 00:56:20,677
Wake me up.!

875
00:56:21,804 --> 00:56:24,349
Oh, I-I'm sorry, Mr. Barish.

876
00:56:24,391 --> 00:56:26,477
I thought you understood
what was going on here.

877
00:56:27,061 --> 00:56:29,647
I don't know.
You're erasing her from me.

878
00:56:30,191 --> 00:56:31,985
You're erasing me from her--

879
00:56:35,656 --> 00:56:36,949
I don't know.

880
00:56:37,158 --> 00:56:40,078
You've got this thing.
I'm in

881
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:41,204
My bed.
I know it.

882
00:56:41,497 --> 00:56:42,999
I'm in my brain.

883
00:56:43,083 --> 00:56:46,337
I'm part of your imagination too, Joel.

884
00:56:46,504 --> 00:56:49,215
How can I help you
from there?

885
00:56:49,216 --> 00:56:52,220
Uh, I'm inside your head too.
I'm you.

886
00:56:55,224 --> 00:56:56,392
Sorry.

887
00:56:56,726 --> 00:56:58,561
Look. Who's that?

888
00:56:58,603 --> 00:57:00,605
Oh, he-he works for us.

889
00:57:00,648 --> 00:57:02,275
That's, uh,

890
00:57:02,275 --> 00:57:05,320
Pa-a-a-a-atrick,

891
00:57:05,362 --> 00:57:07,489
baby boy.

892
00:57:08,158 --> 00:57:09,618
He's stealing my identity.

893
00:57:10,786 --> 00:57:12,413
He stole my stuff.

894
00:57:12,914 --> 00:57:17,002
He's, uh, seducing my girlfriend
with my words and my things.

895
00:57:17,045 --> 00:57:18,547
He stole her underwear.

896
00:57:18,588 --> 00:57:20,590
Oh, Jesus Christ!

897
00:57:20,633 --> 00:57:22,301
He stole her underwear.

898
00:57:22,928 --> 00:57:24,763
I could die right now, Clem.

899
00:57:25,431 --> 00:57:27,266
I'm just happy.

900
00:57:28,310 --> 00:57:30,312
I've never felt that before.

901
00:57:30,312 --> 00:57:32,314
I'm just exactly where
I want to be.

902
00:57:34,652 --> 00:57:35,987
I want to go home.

903
00:57:38,323 --> 00:57:39,825
Hey. What?

904
00:57:42,287 --> 00:57:43,455
Clem!

905
00:57:45,499 --> 00:57:46,667
Wait. Clem!

906
00:57:49,088 --> 00:57:50,089
Clem?

907
00:57:50,548 --> 00:57:52,008
They're erasing you.

908
00:57:55,346 --> 00:57:58,350
Clem, focus.
I hired them,

909
00:57:59,935 --> 00:58:01,687
Sweetie, calm down.

910
00:58:01,729 --> 00:58:04,065
Enjoy the scenery.
I need it to stop

911
00:58:04,108 --> 00:58:06,569
before I wake up and I
don't know you anymore.

912
00:58:08,697 --> 00:58:11,993
Okay, well, you know,
just tell them to cancel it then.

913
00:58:12,035 --> 00:58:14,079
What the hell are you talking about?

914
00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:16,081
I can't just cancel it.
I'm asleep.

915
00:58:16,791 --> 00:58:18,585
Wake yourself up!

916
00:58:18,585 --> 00:58:21,255
Okay. You want me to wake up?
Okay. Great. All right.

917
00:58:21,297 --> 00:58:23,091
Okay, here we go.
This make you happy if I try?
Yeah.

918
00:58:23,133 --> 00:58:24,384
I'll try really hard.

919
00:58:24,426 --> 00:58:26,178
Here we go.
That was a great

920
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:27,763
Idea.
Yeah.

921
00:58:27,848 --> 00:58:29,183
Okay.

922
00:58:29,767 --> 00:58:32,103
Boy, that's working
like gangbusters.

923
00:58:35,817 --> 00:58:37,527
Oh, my God. What is that?
Jesus Christ.! What the--

924
00:58:37,569 --> 00:58:39,488
It's a birthmark.!

925
00:58:42,450 --> 00:58:44,452
It did work, for a second,

926
00:58:45,788 --> 00:58:46,956
But I couldn't--
See?

927
00:58:47,249 --> 00:58:48,959
I couldn't move.

928
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:50,127
Oh, well,

929
00:58:50,169 --> 00:58:53,339
Isn't that just another one
ofJoel's self-fulfilling prophecies?

930
00:58:53,382 --> 00:58:55,843
It's more important
to prove me wrong
than to actually--

931
00:58:55,843 --> 00:58:57,845
Look, I don't want to
discuss this right now, okay?

932
00:58:58,847 --> 00:58:59,973
Fine.

933
00:59:02,143 --> 00:59:03,853
Then what?

934
00:59:04,271 --> 00:59:06,315
I'm listening.
I don't know.

935
00:59:06,357 --> 00:59:09,361
You erased me. That's why I'm here.
That's why I'm doing this

936
00:59:09,403 --> 00:59:10,446
In the first place.

937
00:59:10,488 --> 00:59:12,031
I'm sorry.
You-- You!

938
00:59:12,073 --> 00:59:14,117
You know me. I'm impulsive.

939
00:59:18,373 --> 00:59:20,500
That's what I love
about you.

940
00:59:24,215 --> 00:59:25,591
Joel?

941
00:59:26,593 --> 00:59:28,804
I have another idea
for this problem.

942
00:59:29,263 --> 00:59:30,890
This is a memory of me,

943
00:59:30,932 --> 00:59:33,560
The way you wanted
to have sex on the couch

944
00:59:33,602 --> 00:59:35,688
After you
looked down at my crotch.

945
00:59:36,606 --> 00:59:39,610
What?
Joel, the eraser guys
are coming here,

946
00:59:40,153 --> 00:59:42,113
So what if you take me
somewhere else,

947
00:59:42,113 --> 00:59:43,990
Somewhere
where I don't belong,

948
00:59:44,325 --> 00:59:46,285
And we hide there
till morning?

949
00:59:51,626 --> 00:59:54,671
Oh, man. I can't remember
anything without you.

950
00:59:56,216 --> 00:59:59,303
Tsk, that's very sweet,
but try, okay?

951
01:00:07,648 --> 01:00:09,775
--Row, row, row your boat

952
01:00:09,817 --> 01:00:11,569
gently down the stream --

953
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:15,782
--Merrily, merrily
merrily, merrily --
--Life is but a dream --

954
01:00:24,712 --> 01:00:26,255
It's working!

955
01:00:27,382 --> 01:00:29,050
I'm a genius.!

956
01:00:51,081 --> 01:00:52,457
Joel?

957
01:00:53,751 --> 01:00:55,253
Joel?

958
01:00:56,254 --> 01:00:58,256
Where'd you go?

959
01:00:58,257 --> 01:01:00,468
I'm supposed to come too!

960
01:01:00,468 --> 01:01:02,011
Listen, I'm just gonna
go get a salad bowl.

961
01:01:02,054 --> 01:01:04,307
You can begin with the soup
and to give a glance him to Joel?

962
01:01:04,348 --> 01:01:07,143
Can you stir the soup
and keep an eye on Joel?

963
01:01:07,352 --> 01:01:09,479
Clem?
It worked.

964
01:01:09,981 --> 01:01:11,649
My God, look at this.!

965
01:01:11,691 --> 01:01:13,485
Wow.! It worked.!

966
01:01:14,403 --> 01:01:16,489
Look.! Look at this dress, man.!

967
01:01:17,157 --> 01:01:19,743
Oh, my God! Look at it!
I wish I could take it with me.

968
01:01:22,247 --> 01:01:23,331
Who am I?

969
01:01:23,374 --> 01:01:25,501
Mrs. Hamlyn.
Right. Mrs. Hamlyn.

970
01:01:25,543 --> 01:01:27,128
I must be about four.

971
01:01:27,129 --> 01:01:28,464
Oh, my gosh.

972
01:01:28,506 --> 01:01:31,843
Found the salad bowl,
so I'm serving salad and string beans.

973
01:01:31,885 --> 01:01:34,555
Is he okay under there?
Peanut, are you all right?

974
01:01:34,597 --> 01:01:36,850
God, honestly, I feel like
I could clean up all day.

975
01:01:36,892 --> 01:01:39,854
Listen, would you hate me if I asked you
to clean some string beans?

976
01:01:39,896 --> 01:01:41,231
No, not at all.

977
01:01:41,732 --> 01:01:43,234
Oh, my God.
I love this kitchen.

978
01:01:43,275 --> 01:01:45,444
Thank you so much.

979
01:01:45,487 --> 01:01:47,865
She's not looking at me.
She's busy.

980
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:50,242
She's not looking at me.

981
01:01:50,285 --> 01:01:51,953
No one ever looks at me.

982
01:01:51,954 --> 01:01:53,581
I want my mommy.

983
01:01:53,622 --> 01:01:54,998
Oh, baby Joel.

984
01:01:55,041 --> 01:01:58,420
Hey, Joely.! Joely.!
Is every little peanut
under there okay?

985
01:01:58,462 --> 01:01:59,922
Mm-hmm! He's fine.

986
01:01:59,964 --> 01:02:02,759
Do you have something to drink?
Would you drink
a cocktail at this hour?

987
01:02:02,801 --> 01:02:05,679
- I mean, still nor are the 5:00.
I would die for a vodka.

988
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:07,265
Oh, hang on.
Let me check if I have that.

989
01:02:07,307 --> 01:02:09,977
Okay! I'm just
gonna wait right here.
Joel! Hey, no, sweetie.

990
01:02:10,603 --> 01:02:11,729
Uh, Joely.

991
01:02:11,772 --> 01:02:15,443
Your mother wants me to mind you.
Get back under the table.

992
01:02:15,443 --> 01:02:19,072
Ice cream.
No, not until after, you know,
you've had your dinner.

993
01:02:19,115 --> 01:02:21,117
Come on, Joel.!

994
01:02:22,703 --> 01:02:24,997
Joel, grow up.!
Don't leave me, Clem.

995
01:02:24,998 --> 01:02:27,626
Oh, my God, Clem.
This is sort of warped.

996
01:02:27,668 --> 01:02:29,336
I'm scared.

997
01:02:29,337 --> 01:02:32,048
I want my mommy!
Don't cry, baby Joel.

998
01:02:32,049 --> 01:02:35,053
Baby Joel, it's okay.
Joel. Joely. Joel!

999
01:02:36,388 --> 01:02:38,015
Stop it.! Look, I think it's working.

1000
01:02:38,057 --> 01:02:40,351
Look, we're hidden, Joel. Look.!

1001
01:02:41,019 --> 01:02:42,187
Hey, honey, look.

1002
01:02:42,479 --> 01:02:44,523
Wait there.

1003
01:02:47,862 --> 01:02:51,366
My crotch is still here,
just as you remembered it.

1004
01:02:51,408 --> 01:02:52,868
Yuck.

1005
01:02:56,957 --> 01:02:58,709
It stopped.

1006
01:02:58,751 --> 01:03:00,253
What?

1007
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:02,380
It stopped erasing.

1008
01:03:02,423 --> 01:03:04,926
Oh, shit.

1009
01:03:04,926 --> 01:03:06,761
This is terrible.

1010
01:03:09,098 --> 01:03:11,100
He's off the map.
He's off the map.

1011
01:03:11,101 --> 01:03:12,811
Where?
I don't know where!

1012
01:03:12,853 --> 01:03:14,438
What do you mean? I don't know where!

1013
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:17,609
This is bad.
This is very, very bad news.

1014
01:03:17,651 --> 01:03:19,111
Where are my glasses?

1015
01:03:19,153 --> 01:03:20,321
Okay.

1016
01:03:20,363 --> 01:03:23,533
Crap. Okay.
What do we do?

1017
01:03:23,534 --> 01:03:24,702
What do I do?

1018
01:03:24,702 --> 01:03:27,121
What shall we do?
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.

1019
01:03:27,164 --> 01:03:30,126
- What shall we do?
- Crap. Crap. I don't know!
- I just said that

1020
01:03:30,168 --> 01:03:32,838
- I'm sorry. I don't know what to do.
What do we do?
I don't know.

1021
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:36,843
Mellow out. Now, look, you're
freaking me out. Mellow out.
Well, you have to do something.

1022
01:03:37,094 --> 01:03:38,846
He could wake up

1023
01:03:38,888 --> 01:03:40,807
All half-baked.

1024
01:03:40,849 --> 01:03:43,978
Shh. Shh.
All gooey and-- and half-baked.

1025
01:03:44,813 --> 01:03:46,857
Hmm, that sounds so good.
Oh, shit.!

1026
01:03:46,857 --> 01:03:49,151
I'm hungry.
Oh, shit.

1027
01:03:49,402 --> 01:03:51,655
What? Oh! What, what?
What?

1028
01:03:52,197 --> 01:03:55,201
- We should call Howard.
- No way. No, sir, man.

1029
01:03:55,243 --> 01:03:57,412
This is my--
I can handle this.

1030
01:03:57,413 --> 01:03:59,248
I can't call Howard.
He's an unbaked cookie.

1031
01:04:00,876 --> 01:04:04,213
He's-- There's no time
to fuck around.
I got this under control.

1032
01:04:04,255 --> 01:04:06,215
What are you talking about?
Stop fucking around.!

1033
01:04:06,258 --> 01:04:08,511
Okay, I'll call Howard.

1034
01:04:15,729 --> 01:04:17,397
Hello.
Hello, Howard?

1035
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:20,736
Hey, it's Stan. Um,
I'm working on this guy
down here,

1036
01:04:20,777 --> 01:04:23,447
And we seem to have
lost him for a moment,

1037
01:04:23,489 --> 01:04:25,908
And, uh, I can't--
I can't bring him back up.

1038
01:04:25,909 --> 01:04:29,622
Okay, uh, tell me what happened
before he disappeared.

1039
01:04:29,622 --> 01:04:32,959
Well, I wasn't sure, really,
'cause I was away from the monitor
for a minute...

1040
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:35,588
And I had it on autopilot
because I had to, uh--

1041
01:04:36,006 --> 01:04:38,801
I had to pee.
Where's Patrick?

1042
01:04:38,843 --> 01:04:41,346
Patrick? Patrick had to
go home sick.

1043
01:04:41,388 --> 01:04:43,348
Ah, geez.

1044
01:04:44,142 --> 01:04:45,560
Okay, what's the address?

1045
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:47,729
I know. I'm so sorry.
That's okay. Come on.

1046
01:04:47,772 --> 01:04:50,317
I'm at 159 South Village.
Yeah.

1047
01:04:50,358 --> 01:04:53,320
Apartment 1 E.
Rockville Center.

1048
01:04:53,362 --> 01:04:55,656
Mary? Yeah?
He's coming right now.

1049
01:04:56,116 --> 01:04:57,701
I'm staying.

1050
01:04:57,785 --> 01:04:59,954
- Get your stuff, Mary.
- I'm staying.

1051
01:05:00,330 --> 01:05:01,998
I think you should go.

1052
01:05:02,041 --> 01:05:04,127
Hell, no.
Mary--

1053
01:05:05,504 --> 01:05:06,839
Shit.

1054
01:05:06,881 --> 01:05:10,051
I am so stoned.
Please, Mary.

1055
01:05:11,053 --> 01:05:13,389
You have to go.
Stop being stoned, Mary.

1056
01:05:13,389 --> 01:05:15,725
I don't want him
to see me stoned.

1057
01:05:16,059 --> 01:05:18,729
Mary, you have no idea how much trouble

1058
01:05:18,771 --> 01:05:20,439
we're gonna get into if Howard comes--
I look like shit!

1059
01:05:20,482 --> 01:05:22,442
Joely, stop it.! Joel.!

1060
01:05:22,443 --> 01:05:23,736
Look.! Hey, Joel.!

1061
01:05:29,411 --> 01:05:31,330
Joel!
I want her to pick me up.

1062
01:05:31,330 --> 01:05:33,416
It's weird how strong
that desire is.

1063
01:05:33,458 --> 01:05:35,544
Joel, look at me! Look.

1064
01:05:35,752 --> 01:05:37,420
You'll remember me
in the morning,

1065
01:05:37,463 --> 01:05:40,967
And you'll come to me,
and you'll tell me about us,
and we'll start over.

1066
01:05:41,385 --> 01:05:45,098
Pat? I just-- Pat?
I thought we could have
a little cocktail.

1067
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:46,850
That Patrick guy--

1068
01:05:46,851 --> 01:05:48,770
He's copying me.

1069
01:05:48,812 --> 01:05:50,105
What Patrick guy?

1070
01:05:50,147 --> 01:05:52,483
That guy!
What?

1071
01:05:52,984 --> 01:05:55,654
He's here in my apartment.
He's one of those eraser guys.

1072
01:05:55,696 --> 01:05:57,823
He fell for you when they were doing you,

1073
01:05:57,824 --> 01:06:00,911
And now he's introduced himself
like he doesn't even know you,

1074
01:06:01,495 --> 01:06:03,956
And you guys are dating.
Really?

1075
01:06:04,833 --> 01:06:06,501
Is he cute?

1076
01:06:08,171 --> 01:06:10,257
Clem,
there's nothing wrong with you.

1077
01:06:10,257 --> 01:06:12,551
You're the most wonderful
person I've ever met.

1078
01:06:13,177 --> 01:06:14,595
You--

1079
01:06:14,638 --> 01:06:16,056
You're kind,

1080
01:06:16,932 --> 01:06:18,475
Beautiful...

1081
01:06:18,852 --> 01:06:20,854
And smart and funny...

1082
01:06:20,979 --> 01:06:22,314
And...

1083
01:06:22,523 --> 01:06:24,025
Nice.

1084
01:06:24,526 --> 01:06:26,069
What?

1085
01:06:27,530 --> 01:06:28,865
Okay. All right.

1086
01:06:33,246 --> 01:06:36,083
Move, move, move!
Come on. Let's go.
Careful, careful. Fine.

1087
01:06:37,084 --> 01:06:39,378
Oh, my God. I'm still stoned.

1088
01:06:40,923 --> 01:06:43,426
Those eyedrops you gave me
didn't do shit.

1089
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:50,686
Be cool. Cool.

1090
01:06:54,608 --> 01:06:58,112
Hello, Mary. What are you doing here?
Oh, hi, Howard.
She was just here to help out.

1091
01:06:58,154 --> 01:07:01,950
I wanted to understand as much
as I could about the procedure
as possible.

1092
01:07:01,993 --> 01:07:04,871
I think it's important for my job
to understand

1093
01:07:04,955 --> 01:07:07,374
The inner workings...
of the work that we do.

1094
01:07:07,417 --> 01:07:10,796
Well, not that I do,
but the work that is done...

1095
01:07:10,963 --> 01:07:15,218
By people... where I also work,
the work of my colleagues.

1096
01:07:15,678 --> 01:07:20,017
All right, well,
let's see if we can, uh,
get to the bottom of this,

1097
01:07:20,350 --> 01:07:21,685
Uh, yeah. Um--

1098
01:07:25,065 --> 01:07:27,568
Well, that's odd.
I already tried that.

1099
01:07:27,568 --> 01:07:30,697
Did you try going
through the C-gate?
Yeah, of course.

1100
01:07:31,031 --> 01:07:33,367
I mean... yes.

1101
01:07:34,369 --> 01:07:35,745
Yeah.

1102
01:07:38,041 --> 01:07:39,376
All right.

1103
01:07:41,379 --> 01:07:43,757
You want to get linked up?
Yeah.

1104
01:07:46,302 --> 01:07:50,265
I already-- I ran
the utility programs,
and I had nothing there,

1105
01:07:50,307 --> 01:07:53,728
So I checked all the memories
against the printed logs.

1106
01:07:54,396 --> 01:07:56,815
Here, Howard.
Okay.
I got you a chair.

1107
01:07:56,941 --> 01:07:59,527
Oh, thank you.
You're welcome.

1108
01:08:00,446 --> 01:08:02,240
Whew!
All right, I'm gonna--

1109
01:08:02,281 --> 01:08:04,450
I'm gonna go through
the entire memory,

1110
01:08:04,493 --> 01:08:06,161
see if something comes up.

1111
01:08:07,121 --> 01:08:12,795
- Oh, my darling
Oh, my darling -
- Oh, my darling Clementine -

1112
01:08:13,171 --> 01:08:15,465
- You were lost
and gone forever -
I love being bathed in the sink.

1113
01:08:15,507 --> 01:08:17,551
- Dreadful sorry, Clementine --
Such a feeling of security.

1114
01:08:18,261 --> 01:08:20,639
I've never seen you happier,
baby Joel.

1115
01:08:21,474 --> 01:08:23,101
Hmm!
There it is.

1116
01:08:23,476 --> 01:08:26,980
I don't understand
why it's off the map like that.

1117
01:08:28,358 --> 01:08:30,318
What the heck
was he doing there?

1118
01:08:39,706 --> 01:08:41,249
His eyes are open.

1119
01:08:43,712 --> 01:08:46,215
- Has this happened before with him?
- No.

1120
01:08:47,216 --> 01:08:49,761
Oh, this is--
this is not good. No.

1121
01:08:50,721 --> 01:08:52,139
I'm gonna have to--

1122
01:08:52,849 --> 01:08:54,893
I'm gonna have to give him this.

1123
01:09:19,635 --> 01:09:22,472
Can't you see I love you,
Antoine?

1124
01:09:23,139 --> 01:09:24,974
Okay, we're back in.

1125
01:09:25,392 --> 01:09:26,601
Wow.

1126
01:09:26,978 --> 01:09:29,982
That was beautiful
to watch, Howard.
Like a surgeon

1127
01:09:30,316 --> 01:09:32,652
Or a concert pianist
or something.

1128
01:09:34,321 --> 01:09:35,656
Thank you, Mary.

1129
01:09:36,991 --> 01:09:39,995
Um, Howard,
you should get some sleep.
I-I think I'll be fine now.

1130
01:09:40,037 --> 01:09:41,539
Why can't you see

1131
01:09:41,581 --> 01:09:44,000
I love you, Antoine?

1132
01:09:45,670 --> 01:09:46,963
Hmm. Lucky me.

1133
01:09:46,963 --> 01:09:48,214
Lay one on me.

1134
01:09:53,013 --> 01:09:55,850
Don't call me Antoine.
My name is Wally.

1135
01:09:55,892 --> 01:09:59,438
Yes, I know,
but how can a woman love a man
with a name like Wally?

1136
01:10:00,648 --> 01:10:02,066
Oh.! Oh.! What was that?

1137
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:04,736
Hey.
My God, there's people
coming out of your butt.

1138
01:10:04,778 --> 01:10:06,113
There is?

1139
01:10:08,825 --> 01:10:10,952
- Got it.
- Tangerine!

1140
01:10:11,663 --> 01:10:14,208
What, Joel-- What are you doing?
We gotta go.

1141
01:10:14,249 --> 01:10:16,752
Go on. Please, please, go.
Please go!

1142
01:10:19,924 --> 01:10:21,843
You can run,
but you can't hide.

1143
01:10:21,885 --> 01:10:23,595
Clem, come on!

1144
01:10:24,638 --> 01:10:26,056
There I am.

1145
01:10:28,477 --> 01:10:30,020
Doc?

1146
01:10:30,605 --> 01:10:32,440
Please.

1147
01:10:38,448 --> 01:10:41,827
That's strange.
He's in a memory
that we've already erased.

1148
01:10:42,370 --> 01:10:44,831
Oh, well, at least
we know where he is.

1149
01:10:44,832 --> 01:10:46,834
He's back on track, right?

1150
01:10:47,502 --> 01:10:49,212
Come on, Clem.
He seems to have developed some sort

1151
01:10:49,254 --> 01:10:52,174
of resistance to the procedure.
I don't want to run anymore.

1152
01:10:53,677 --> 01:10:54,845
Shit.

1153
01:10:56,180 --> 01:10:57,181
Come on, come on.

1154
01:10:57,223 --> 01:10:59,893
Hide me somewhere deeper,
somewhere really buried.
Where?

1155
01:11:00,812 --> 01:11:02,522
Hide me in your humiliation.

1156
01:11:03,774 --> 01:11:05,192
Humiliation.

1157
01:11:18,544 --> 01:11:20,254
- No, wait. Howard.

1158
01:11:21,214 --> 01:11:23,216
He's disappeared again.

1159
01:11:23,300 --> 01:11:24,927
Oh, dear.

1160
01:11:26,220 --> 01:11:27,722
I'm so sorry, Howard.

1161
01:11:27,764 --> 01:11:29,057
Humiliation.

1162
01:11:30,059 --> 01:11:31,435
Humiliation.

1163
01:11:32,270 --> 01:11:35,065
Hu-mi-lia--
Joel.

1164
01:11:36,276 --> 01:11:37,981
I don't like it either.

1165
01:11:37,991 --> 01:11:39,779
I'm just trying to find
horrible secret places to--

1166
01:11:39,822 --> 01:11:42,116
Joel, honey, I have a surprise--
I just-- Oh, um--

1167
01:11:43,619 --> 01:11:45,955
Uh, you know what, honey?
I'm just gonna ask you in the morning.

1168
01:11:46,664 --> 01:11:48,458
Good night, sweetheart.

1169
01:11:51,796 --> 01:11:54,299
No, I'm sorry, Joel. Joely.
Shut up.

1170
01:11:55,593 --> 01:11:56,969
Look!

1171
01:11:57,012 --> 01:11:58,472
Joel!

1172
01:11:58,597 --> 01:12:00,307
Joel, look!
What?

1173
01:12:00,516 --> 01:12:02,310
Look where we are!

1174
01:12:03,187 --> 01:12:04,188
Whoo!

1175
01:12:05,022 --> 01:12:06,023
Clem,

1176
01:12:06,232 --> 01:12:08,860
This isn't good.
Then hide me somewhere--

1177
01:12:08,861 --> 01:12:11,823
Somewhere really buried.

1178
01:12:11,948 --> 01:12:14,868
Hit it! Hit it! Joel!

1179
01:12:14,869 --> 01:12:16,579
I can't! I gotta go home.

1180
01:12:16,579 --> 01:12:18,581
I'll do it later.!

1181
01:12:18,582 --> 01:12:21,085
Come on,

1182
01:12:21,753 --> 01:12:23,547
You big sissy!

1183
01:12:38,150 --> 01:12:41,320
Ooh.!
Ooh, he has a girlfriend.!
Wait. What am I doing?

1184
01:12:41,362 --> 01:12:43,865
You know something, Freddy?
And he loves her.!
You don't scare me anymore.

1185
01:12:46,077 --> 01:12:47,412
Ow! Ow!
Joel!

1186
01:12:47,412 --> 01:12:49,790
Joely, get up.
Come on, it's not worth it.

1187
01:12:49,832 --> 01:12:51,792
Hit him! Hit him!
They're not worth it, Joel!

1188
01:12:53,379 --> 01:12:55,131
Tra-la-la-la-la! He's not listening!

1189
01:12:55,131 --> 01:12:56,466
Come on, Joel.
Stupid!

1190
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:04,643
I'm so ashamed.

1191
01:13:04,685 --> 01:13:06,312
It's okay.

1192
01:13:06,479 --> 01:13:08,648
You were a little kid.
Yeah?

1193
01:13:08,691 --> 01:13:10,401
Come on.
That's where I live--

1194
01:13:10,443 --> 01:13:11,819
lived.

1195
01:13:11,862 --> 01:13:13,822
I wish I knew you
when I was a kid.

1196
01:13:13,864 --> 01:13:16,158
Do you like my pink hat?
Here, look, feel better.

1197
01:13:16,201 --> 01:13:18,495
You can really kill me this time.

1198
01:13:18,537 --> 01:13:20,331
It's my turn.
Go. One, two, three.
I can? You're really gonna die though.

1199
01:13:20,373 --> 01:13:23,001
Okay.
One, two, three.

1200
01:13:23,001 --> 01:13:24,711
You're dead.

1201
01:13:25,296 --> 01:13:27,006
Oh, my mom.

1202
01:13:27,049 --> 01:13:29,176
It's-- It's okay. We're playing.

1203
01:13:29,218 --> 01:13:31,596
Hi, Joel's mom.
It's not real.
He's killing me.

1204
01:13:32,347 --> 01:13:34,892
Okay, are you dead yet?
You're dead.!

1205
01:13:36,227 --> 01:13:38,938
Uh, I think I got the hang of this.
I still don't understand it,

1206
01:13:38,939 --> 01:13:41,275
But I'm finding him quickly enough.

1207
01:14:17,324 --> 01:14:18,325
Jo--Joely?

1208
01:14:18,784 --> 01:14:20,327
Are you okay, Joel?

1209
01:14:21,204 --> 01:14:23,331
Joel? Joel?

1210
01:14:24,500 --> 01:14:26,586
Oh, my God.
That was terrible.

1211
01:14:27,337 --> 01:14:29,423
Okay, okay.
That was like three seconds.
All right.

1212
01:14:29,423 --> 01:14:30,591
Let me do it one more time.

1213
01:14:30,592 --> 01:14:32,344
One more, then I get to go.
Okay.

1214
01:14:45,361 --> 01:14:47,363
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Whoo! Look at this.
This is so cool!

1215
01:14:47,406 --> 01:14:49,200
Cool. Look out! Look out!

1216
01:15:01,258 --> 01:15:02,718
Whoo-hoo!
Come on.

1217
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:04,428
Whoo-hoo!
We gotta go!

1218
01:15:06,932 --> 01:15:08,475
Come on!

1219
01:15:10,019 --> 01:15:11,771
We gotta go. Clem?

1220
01:15:11,813 --> 01:15:13,398
We gotta go.

1221
01:15:16,445 --> 01:15:18,781
No!
This is a really bad time
for this!

1222
01:15:18,823 --> 01:15:20,992
Get off me! Oh, God!

1223
01:15:21,785 --> 01:15:24,413
I don't even know
where we're going.
It's gonna be fun. Come on.

1224
01:15:24,789 --> 01:15:26,499
It's the best place.
No, this way.

1225
01:15:26,541 --> 01:15:28,084
No, this way.
No, no, no. This way.

1226
01:15:29,545 --> 01:15:31,464
You're no help at all.

1227
01:15:35,178 --> 01:15:37,222
Let go of me, Joel!

1228
01:15:50,198 --> 01:15:52,284
I like watching you work,
Howard.

1229
01:15:56,874 --> 01:15:58,125
I guess, uh--

1230
01:15:58,584 --> 01:16:02,881
I guess I'll go out
for-- for some air,
if nobody minds.

1231
01:16:02,923 --> 01:16:05,801
It looks like you have everything
under control here.

1232
01:16:07,137 --> 01:16:10,141
Yeah, that's, uh--
that's fine.

1233
01:16:20,947 --> 01:16:22,615
Do you like quotes, Howard?

1234
01:16:24,786 --> 01:16:25,954
What do you mean?

1235
01:16:25,996 --> 01:16:29,166
Oh, you know,
like famous quotes?

1236
01:16:29,167 --> 01:16:31,461
I find reading them inspirational,

1237
01:16:31,503 --> 01:16:35,466
And in my reading,
I've come across some
I thought you might like too.

1238
01:16:35,509 --> 01:16:36,969
Oh, well, I--

1239
01:16:37,553 --> 01:16:39,305
I'd love to hear some.

1240
01:16:39,347 --> 01:16:41,057
There's one that goes,

1241
01:16:41,099 --> 01:16:42,976
''Blessed are the forgetful,

1242
01:16:43,019 --> 01:16:45,021
For they get the better even of their blunders.''

1243
01:16:45,063 --> 01:16:46,982
That's Nietzsche, right?
Yeah.

1244
01:16:47,024 --> 01:16:49,151
And here I thought I could tell you
something you didn't know.

1245
01:16:49,193 --> 01:16:51,988
Oh, no.
It's-- It's a good quote.

1246
01:16:52,031 --> 01:16:54,742
I'm happy we both know it.
Yeah.

1247
01:16:55,494 --> 01:16:59,040
Oh, and there's this other one I like.
It's by Pope Alexander,

1248
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:00,917
And it goes--
Alexander Pope?

1249
01:17:01,126 --> 01:17:03,379
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, shit.

1250
01:17:03,546 --> 01:17:04,839
It's just that

1251
01:17:04,881 --> 01:17:07,050
I told myself not to
say ''Pope Alexander''

1252
01:17:07,092 --> 01:17:09,553
and sound like a dope,
and then I go ahead and say it.

1253
01:17:09,596 --> 01:17:12,474
It's no big deal.
You're such a sweetheart.

1254
01:17:15,395 --> 01:17:16,479
The quote goes,

1255
01:17:16,522 --> 01:17:19,400
''How happy is the
blameless vestal's lot?

1256
01:17:20,485 --> 01:17:22,821
''The world forgetting,
by the world forgot.

1257
01:17:24,282 --> 01:17:26,868
''Eternal sunshine
of the spotless mind.

1258
01:17:28,037 --> 01:17:30,039
Each prayer accepted

1259
01:17:30,415 --> 01:17:31,750
and each wish resigned. ''

1260
01:17:31,792 --> 01:17:36,423
I want to be
a great big, huge elephant...

1261
01:17:37,091 --> 01:17:39,427
with a huge trunk like that.

1262
01:17:40,679 --> 01:17:41,805
Clem?

1263
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:43,641
Clementine?

1264
01:17:43,641 --> 01:17:46,561
I haven't heard that one.
It's lovely.

1265
01:17:46,603 --> 01:17:49,189
I just thought it would
be appropriate, maybe.

1266
01:17:54,155 --> 01:17:56,992
I really admire
the work you do, Howard.

1267
01:17:58,161 --> 01:18:01,248
I don't mean to be so familiar.
Oh, it's fine. It's fine.
I-I-I-I-I--

1268
01:18:01,498 --> 01:18:03,333
I'm happy to hear--

1269
01:18:08,841 --> 01:18:10,509
I'm sorry.

1270
01:18:14,182 --> 01:18:16,518
I've loved you
for a very long time.

1271
01:18:19,689 --> 01:18:21,191
I shouldn't have said that.

1272
01:18:21,358 --> 01:18:24,403
Oh, Mary, no.
It's-- You're a wonderful girl.

1273
01:18:25,572 --> 01:18:26,865
But I--

1274
01:18:26,907 --> 01:18:31,246
You know,
I have a wife and kids.

1275
01:18:31,538 --> 01:18:33,498
Oh, Mary.

1276
01:18:35,502 --> 01:18:37,963
Oh, Mary, we can't do this.

1277
01:18:54,611 --> 01:18:56,613
Well, good morning,
Mrs. Mierzwiak.

1278
01:19:06,335 --> 01:19:07,544
What?
Oh, my God.!

1279
01:19:07,587 --> 01:19:09,255
Who is it?

1280
01:19:22,356 --> 01:19:24,692
Thank you, Stan.
Thanks a lot.

1281
01:19:29,908 --> 01:19:32,077
Hollis. Hollis!

1282
01:19:32,870 --> 01:19:34,079
Hollis.!

1283
01:19:35,332 --> 01:19:37,376
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
Hollis.

1284
01:19:38,253 --> 01:19:40,714
- I knew it, Howard.
- Hollis, it didn't start out
to be like this.

1285
01:19:40,756 --> 01:19:44,552
I came here to work.
Hollis, this is a one-time mistake!

1286
01:19:44,594 --> 01:19:46,638
I'm a stupid girl
with a stupid crush.!
Yeah.

1287
01:19:46,680 --> 01:19:48,933
I swear I basically
forced him into it!

1288
01:19:50,436 --> 01:19:53,440
Don't be a monster, Howard.
Tell the girl.

1289
01:19:56,110 --> 01:19:57,778
Tell me what?

1290
01:19:58,029 --> 01:19:59,948
Oh, you poor kid.

1291
01:20:01,617 --> 01:20:03,369
You can have him.

1292
01:20:03,787 --> 01:20:05,455
You did.

1293
01:20:15,552 --> 01:20:16,803
What?

1294
01:20:27,151 --> 01:20:29,404
We have a history.

1295
01:20:30,864 --> 01:20:34,034
I'm sorry.
Y-You wanted the procedure.

1296
01:20:35,871 --> 01:20:37,873
You-- You wanted it done...

1297
01:20:38,208 --> 01:20:41,587
So you could get past, uh--

1298
01:20:43,214 --> 01:20:44,882
You could-- Yeah.

1299
01:20:48,221 --> 01:20:49,889
Um, I have to, uh,

1300
01:20:49,932 --> 01:20:53,019
Finish the work in there.
It's almost morning.

1301
01:20:54,938 --> 01:20:56,398
We'll talk later.

1302
01:20:57,734 --> 01:20:59,027
Okay?

1303
01:21:16,968 --> 01:21:18,970
Let me give you a lift home.

1304
01:21:28,316 --> 01:21:30,485
Fuck this thing. Damn it.

1305
01:21:30,778 --> 01:21:33,072
Hi.
Hi.

1306
01:21:34,658 --> 01:21:37,828
Didn't figure you'd show your face
around me again.

1307
01:21:38,955 --> 01:21:40,415
I guess I thought
you were...

1308
01:21:40,916 --> 01:21:44,337
Humiliated.
You did run away,
after all.

1309
01:21:44,379 --> 01:21:46,006
I just needed to see ya.

1310
01:21:46,048 --> 01:21:47,675
Yeah?

1311
01:21:49,011 --> 01:21:50,763
I'd like to, um,

1312
01:21:52,056 --> 01:21:54,392
Take you out or something.

1313
01:21:54,893 --> 01:21:56,395
You're married.

1314
01:21:57,397 --> 01:21:59,942
Not yet. Not married.

1315
01:22:00,442 --> 01:22:02,069
No, I'm not married, no.

1316
01:22:02,111 --> 01:22:05,824
Look, man,
I'm telling you right off the bat
I'm high maintenance,

1317
01:22:06,325 --> 01:22:09,579
So I'm not gonna tiptoe
around your marriage...

1318
01:22:09,621 --> 01:22:11,957
Or whatever it is
you've got going there.

1319
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,586
If you wanna be with me,
you're with me.

1320
01:22:15,421 --> 01:22:16,505
Okay.

1321
01:22:17,298 --> 01:22:21,386
Too many guys think I'm a concept,
or I complete them,

1322
01:22:21,387 --> 01:22:23,222
Or I'm gonna make them alive.

1323
01:22:23,640 --> 01:22:27,102
But I'm just a fucked-up girl
who's looking for
my own peace of mind.

1324
01:22:27,353 --> 01:22:29,105
Don't assign me yours.

1325
01:22:29,147 --> 01:22:31,149
I remember that speech
really well.

1326
01:22:31,943 --> 01:22:33,737
I had you pegged, didn't I?

1327
01:22:33,779 --> 01:22:36,157
You had the whole
human race pegged.

1328
01:22:36,157 --> 01:22:37,825
Hmm. Probably.

1329
01:22:39,828 --> 01:22:41,872
I still thought you were
gonna save my life,

1330
01:22:42,373 --> 01:22:44,167
Even after that.

1331
01:22:45,836 --> 01:22:47,338
Mmm. I know.

1332
01:22:49,675 --> 01:22:51,260
It would be different...

1333
01:22:53,180 --> 01:22:55,516
If we could just give it
another go around.

1334
01:22:59,480 --> 01:23:01,524
Remember me.

1335
01:23:01,983 --> 01:23:03,693
Try your best.

1336
01:23:06,531 --> 01:23:08,199
Maybe we can.

1337
01:23:39,575 --> 01:23:44,790
Okay, so just tell me what
you remember, and, uh, then
we'll take it from there.

1338
01:23:44,957 --> 01:23:46,166
Okay.

1339
01:23:47,502 --> 01:23:49,796
I liked you immediately.

1340
01:23:50,298 --> 01:23:52,634
You didn't
come on to me at all.

1341
01:23:52,843 --> 01:23:54,470
I liked that.

1342
01:23:56,347 --> 01:23:59,017
I was so tongue-tied
around you at first.

1343
01:23:59,059 --> 01:24:01,186
I wanted you to think
I was smart.

1344
01:24:02,981 --> 01:24:05,275
I couldn't wait
to come to work.

1345
01:24:05,318 --> 01:24:08,780
I had these fantasies
of us being married...

1346
01:24:08,822 --> 01:24:10,365
And having kids and...

1347
01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:12,201
Just--

1348
01:24:12,285 --> 01:24:14,454
Oh, Howie, I can't do this.

1349
01:24:15,039 --> 01:24:17,709
We agreed it's for the best, Mary.

1350
01:24:17,751 --> 01:24:19,378
Yeah, I know.

1351
01:24:20,630 --> 01:24:22,048
Oh, God.

1352
01:24:22,299 --> 01:24:24,426
I'll take the bottom and you--
Uh-uh-uh! No, no, no. Here.

1353
01:24:24,677 --> 01:24:26,387
I can take that.
So you want me to carry that?

1354
01:24:26,429 --> 01:24:27,722
Can you get the cooler?

1355
01:24:27,764 --> 01:24:29,891
Honey, the cooler is--
That's light, huh?

1356
01:24:30,059 --> 01:24:32,228
Oh, I can get that.
You can get it.
No, no, no, no!

1357
01:24:33,897 --> 01:24:35,565
Don't take anything.

1358
01:24:35,566 --> 01:24:38,528
I can take the plane.
Put the thing up.
Put the gate back up.

1359
01:24:41,783 --> 01:24:43,618
This is the day we met.

1360
01:24:43,952 --> 01:24:45,495
You were down by the surf.

1361
01:24:45,538 --> 01:24:47,624
I could just make you out
in the distance.

1362
01:24:47,666 --> 01:24:49,960
I remember being drawn to you
even then.

1363
01:24:50,461 --> 01:24:53,840
I thought, ''Wow, how odd.
I'm drawn to someone's back. ''

1364
01:24:55,051 --> 01:24:56,719
You were in that orange sweatshirt

1365
01:24:56,720 --> 01:24:58,806
that I would come to know so well...

1366
01:24:58,847 --> 01:25:00,891
and even hate, eventually.

1367
01:25:00,975 --> 01:25:05,022
At the time I thought,
''How cool! An orange sweatshirt.''

1368
01:25:05,064 --> 01:25:06,482
Hi there.

1369
01:25:08,485 --> 01:25:09,736
Hi.

1370
01:25:09,779 --> 01:25:11,155
I saw you

1371
01:25:11,155 --> 01:25:12,823
Sitting over here...

1372
01:25:12,866 --> 01:25:14,159
By yourself,

1373
01:25:14,827 --> 01:25:16,078
And I thought,

1374
01:25:16,329 --> 01:25:17,580
''Thank God.

1375
01:25:17,622 --> 01:25:21,210
Someone normal
who doesn't know how to interact
at these things either.''

1376
01:25:21,211 --> 01:25:22,546
Yeah.

1377
01:25:22,754 --> 01:25:25,799
I don't ever know what to say.

1378
01:25:26,050 --> 01:25:27,885
I'm Clementine.

1379
01:25:28,762 --> 01:25:32,266
Can I borrow a piece
of your chicken?

1380
01:25:32,643 --> 01:25:34,228
And then you just took it...

1381
01:25:34,270 --> 01:25:36,564
Without waiting for an answer.

1382
01:25:40,653 --> 01:25:42,238
It was so intimate,

1383
01:25:42,781 --> 01:25:44,908
Like we were already lovers.

1384
01:25:46,953 --> 01:25:48,288
I'm Joel.

1385
01:25:49,081 --> 01:25:50,499
Hi, Joel.

1386
01:25:51,167 --> 01:25:53,420
So, no jokes about my name.

1387
01:25:54,422 --> 01:25:55,590
You mean like--

1388
01:25:55,632 --> 01:25:58,636
- Oh, my darling, oh, my darling
Oh, my darling Clementine -

1389
01:25:59,095 --> 01:26:01,014
Huckleberry Hound,
that sort of thing?

1390
01:26:01,681 --> 01:26:03,683
Yeah. Like that.

1391
01:26:03,726 --> 01:26:05,645
Oh, no jokes. No jokes.

1392
01:26:05,979 --> 01:26:07,898
One of my favorite things when I was a kid

1393
01:26:07,940 --> 01:26:09,817
Was my Huckleberry Hound doll.
Oh.

1394
01:26:13,572 --> 01:26:15,783
I think your name is magical.

1395
01:26:18,829 --> 01:26:20,164
This is it, Joel.

1396
01:26:21,333 --> 01:26:23,502
It's gonna be gone soon.

1397
01:26:25,713 --> 01:26:26,839
I know.

1398
01:26:27,883 --> 01:26:29,176
What do we do?

1399
01:26:32,347 --> 01:26:34,307
Enjoy it.

1400
01:26:51,247 --> 01:26:53,207
You married?
No.

1401
01:26:53,250 --> 01:26:55,628
Let's move into
this neighborhood!

1402
01:26:55,670 --> 01:26:56,963
I do sort of live

1403
01:26:56,963 --> 01:26:58,757
With someone though.

1404
01:26:58,799 --> 01:27:00,426
Male or female?

1405
01:27:00,468 --> 01:27:01,761
What?

1406
01:27:01,803 --> 01:27:04,473
Female. Female.

1407
01:27:06,518 --> 01:27:09,355
At least I'm not barking
up the wrong tree.

1408
01:27:12,776 --> 01:27:14,486
You know these people?

1409
01:27:14,529 --> 01:27:16,615
No, of course not.
Come on.

1410
01:27:18,492 --> 01:27:20,327
They might have a dog.

1411
01:27:20,495 --> 01:27:22,122
There's no dog.

1412
01:27:23,624 --> 01:27:25,167
What are you doing?

1413
01:27:25,585 --> 01:27:27,337
It's freezing out.

1414
01:27:27,838 --> 01:27:29,214
I can't believe this.

1415
01:27:32,177 --> 01:27:34,221
- Clementine!
- There we go. Whoo-hoo.!

1416
01:27:41,857 --> 01:27:43,192
Come on, man.

1417
01:27:43,234 --> 01:27:45,111
The water's fine.

1418
01:27:45,820 --> 01:27:48,365
Nobody's coming here tonight.
Believe me.

1419
01:27:51,244 --> 01:27:52,829
It's dark.

1420
01:27:52,997 --> 01:27:54,707
So, uh,

1421
01:27:54,749 --> 01:27:57,419
What's your girlfriend's name?

1422
01:27:57,962 --> 01:28:00,298
Naomi, but we're not really--

1423
01:28:00,674 --> 01:28:02,885
I mean-- We're--
Whatever.

1424
01:28:03,010 --> 01:28:05,555
So this is great.
Now I can look for, um,

1425
01:28:05,889 --> 01:28:08,183
candles, matches...

1426
01:28:08,225 --> 01:28:10,936
and the liquor cabinet.
Oh, God.

1427
01:28:17,947 --> 01:28:20,617
I think we should go.
There's no phone line.

1428
01:28:21,284 --> 01:28:23,078
What?
I think we should go.

1429
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:25,456
Why? It's our house...

1430
01:28:25,624 --> 01:28:28,335
Just for tonight.
We are

1431
01:28:28,377 --> 01:28:30,796
''David and Ruth Laskin.''

1432
01:28:31,131 --> 01:28:32,758
Which one do you want to be?

1433
01:28:33,300 --> 01:28:35,094
Uh--
I prefer to be Ruth, but

1434
01:28:35,387 --> 01:28:37,347
I can be flexible.

1435
01:28:38,975 --> 01:28:39,976
What are you do--

1436
01:28:42,312 --> 01:28:43,897
Alcohol!

1437
01:28:43,898 --> 01:28:45,149
Oh, boy.
So,

1438
01:28:45,150 --> 01:28:48,028
Are you okay with wine?
I don't know.

1439
01:28:48,362 --> 01:28:49,697
Well, you choose the wine.

1440
01:28:49,697 --> 01:28:52,867
I'm gonna go find the bedroom
and slip into something more...

1441
01:28:53,202 --> 01:28:54,787
Ruth.

1442
01:28:57,374 --> 01:28:59,752
I'm Ruth-less at the moment.
I really should go.

1443
01:29:02,590 --> 01:29:04,843
I've gotta catch my ride.

1444
01:29:06,637 --> 01:29:08,389
So go.

1445
01:29:09,557 --> 01:29:10,641
I did.

1446
01:29:11,768 --> 01:29:14,062
I thought maybe you were a nut,

1447
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:15,940
but you were exciting.

1448
01:29:18,402 --> 01:29:20,196
I wish you'd stayed.

1449
01:29:20,238 --> 01:29:21,573
I wish I'd stayed too.

1450
01:29:21,615 --> 01:29:23,158
Now I wish I'd stayed.

1451
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:25,202
I wish I'd done a lot of things.

1452
01:29:27,414 --> 01:29:28,874
Oh, God, I wish I had--

1453
01:29:32,797 --> 01:29:34,299
I wish I'd stayed.

1454
01:29:34,883 --> 01:29:36,969
I do.
Well, I came back downstairs,

1455
01:29:37,011 --> 01:29:39,848
and you were gone.
I walked out. I walked out the door.

1456
01:29:40,473 --> 01:29:42,141
Why?
I don't know.

1457
01:29:42,142 --> 01:29:44,353
I felt like a scared little kid.
I was like--

1458
01:29:45,146 --> 01:29:46,981
It was above my head.
I don't know.

1459
01:29:47,024 --> 01:29:49,485
You were scared?
Yeah.

1460
01:29:51,530 --> 01:29:53,741
Thought you knew that
about me.

1461
01:29:54,701 --> 01:29:58,497
I ran back to the bonfire,
trying to outrun my humiliation, I think.

1462
01:29:59,457 --> 01:30:01,167
Was it something I said?

1463
01:30:01,502 --> 01:30:02,586
Yeah.

1464
01:30:05,131 --> 01:30:06,758
You said, ''So go''...

1465
01:30:07,510 --> 01:30:09,679
With such disdain, you know?

1466
01:30:09,721 --> 01:30:11,723
Oh, I'm sorry.

1467
01:30:11,724 --> 01:30:12,892
It's okay.

1468
01:30:18,566 --> 01:30:19,567
Joely?

1469
01:30:20,902 --> 01:30:22,779
What if you stayed this time?

1470
01:30:25,784 --> 01:30:27,661
I walked out the door.

1471
01:30:28,746 --> 01:30:30,248
There's no memory left.

1472
01:30:30,290 --> 01:30:32,918
Come back and make up
a good-bye, at least.

1473
01:30:33,836 --> 01:30:35,588
Let's pretend we had one.

1474
01:30:46,937 --> 01:30:48,564
Bye, Joel.

1475
01:30:49,274 --> 01:30:50,942
I love you.

1476
01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:54,739
Meet me in Montauk.

1477
01:30:59,621 --> 01:31:04,043
I didn't crash the plane.
The plane crashed.
I didn't crash the plane.

1478
01:31:10,010 --> 01:31:13,347
You're stoned, and you're driving.
Yeah, the pot balances it out.

1479
01:31:13,389 --> 01:31:17,060
The pot brings you back up. That's why I smoke it.
If I'm going to be drinking, then I'll smoke it.

1480
01:31:18,646 --> 01:31:23,235
It does. That's a medical fact.
It was proven on the Science Network.

1481
01:31:23,277 --> 01:31:25,321
Honey, just watch the road.

1482
01:31:25,322 --> 01:31:26,824
I can't see shit.

1483
01:31:28,451 --> 01:31:31,413
I saw you talking
to somebody pretty.

1484
01:31:31,622 --> 01:31:33,374
She was nice.
Yeah, man. Who was that?

1485
01:31:36,754 --> 01:31:38,297
She was, um,

1486
01:31:39,090 --> 01:31:40,592
Just a girl.

1487
01:31:47,768 --> 01:31:49,061
Okay.

1488
01:32:25,861 --> 01:32:28,572
So I gotta--
I gotta drop the van off.

1489
01:32:28,740 --> 01:32:30,408
Thanks, Stan. Thanks.

1490
01:32:30,868 --> 01:32:32,453
We'll talk.

1491
01:33:51,976 --> 01:33:53,185
Hey!

1492
01:33:55,522 --> 01:33:56,690
Hey.

1493
01:33:58,485 --> 01:34:00,028
You got a lot
of your stuff there, I see.

1494
01:34:00,070 --> 01:34:01,947
Yeah, that's right. My stuff.
I take it you're not coming back.

1495
01:34:02,991 --> 01:34:06,078
I wouldn't come back if I was you either.
Do you swear you didn't know?

1496
01:34:06,120 --> 01:34:07,538
I-I swear.

1497
01:34:08,707 --> 01:34:10,558
So you didn't do the erasing?

1498
01:34:10,569 --> 01:34:12,253
Of course not. God, no.

1499
01:34:12,253 --> 01:34:14,589
And you never even suspected
we were together?

1500
01:34:15,424 --> 01:34:17,092
Once, maybe.

1501
01:34:18,804 --> 01:34:21,766
I was coming back from a job,
and you were at his car.

1502
01:34:21,808 --> 01:34:24,019
I saw you two talking.

1503
01:34:24,603 --> 01:34:27,273
So I waved to you,
and you giggled, you know.

1504
01:34:28,149 --> 01:34:29,692
How'd I look?

1505
01:34:32,071 --> 01:34:33,656
You looked happy.

1506
01:34:33,740 --> 01:34:35,617
Happy with a

1507
01:34:35,659 --> 01:34:37,119
Secret.

1508
01:34:37,871 --> 01:34:39,122
And after that?

1509
01:34:39,164 --> 01:34:42,501
I never saw you two together
again like that, so I just--

1510
01:34:42,710 --> 01:34:45,630
I don't know. I just figured
I was imagining things.

1511
01:35:11,749 --> 01:35:14,210
I really like you, Mary Svevo.

1512
01:35:14,878 --> 01:35:16,380
You know that?

1513
01:35:27,395 --> 01:35:28,730
Thanks.

1514
01:36:03,819 --> 01:36:05,821
Let me get my toothbrush.
Yeah. Just--

1515
01:36:20,549 --> 01:36:22,551
Where are you, Clem?
I'm worried.

1516
01:36:23,428 --> 01:36:27,099
La-la-la-la-la.
I feel like you're mad at me,
and I don't know what I did.

1517
01:36:28,560 --> 01:36:32,148
What did I do?
I love you so much.

1518
01:36:32,315 --> 01:36:34,150
I'll do anything
to make you happy.

1519
01:36:34,568 --> 01:36:36,779
Tell me what you want me to do,
and I'll do it.

1520
01:36:38,490 --> 01:36:41,243
Listen, I'm gonna stop by this morning
just to make sure you're okay.
Oh. Whew.

1521
01:36:54,553 --> 01:36:56,639
Vámonos, señor.

1522
01:36:57,641 --> 01:37:00,060
I-I had a really nice time
last night.

1523
01:37:01,312 --> 01:37:02,355
Nice?

1524
01:37:02,564 --> 01:37:06,319
I had the best fucking night
of my entire fucking life...

1525
01:37:06,361 --> 01:37:09,323
Last night.
That's better.

1526
01:37:13,495 --> 01:37:14,663
This is weird.

1527
01:37:14,705 --> 01:37:17,250
To all patients
of Dr. Howard Mierzwiak.

1528
01:37:17,292 --> 01:37:20,337
My name is Mary Svevo.
''We've met,
but you don't remember me.

1529
01:37:20,379 --> 01:37:22,715
I worked for a company you hired

1530
01:37:22,758 --> 01:37:25,344
To have part of your memory erased.''

1531
01:37:25,386 --> 01:37:28,515
I have since decided
that this is a horrible--
Some kind of teaser ad or something.

1532
01:37:28,557 --> 01:37:32,395
In order to correct this,
I'm sending everyone's file back to them.

1533
01:37:33,897 --> 01:37:36,358
My name is Clementine Kruczynski.

1534
01:37:36,818 --> 01:37:39,529
I'm here to erase Joel Barish.

1535
01:37:39,905 --> 01:37:40,948
What is this?

1536
01:37:40,990 --> 01:37:42,158
I don't know.

1537
01:37:42,200 --> 01:37:44,077
He's boring.
Is that enough

1538
01:37:44,912 --> 01:37:46,288
reason to erase someone?

1539
01:37:46,623 --> 01:37:50,586
I've been thinking lately
how I was before and how I am now,
and it's like he changed me.

1540
01:37:50,628 --> 01:37:52,714
I feel like I'm always pissy now.

1541
01:37:52,714 --> 01:37:55,968
I don't like myself when I'm with him.
I don't like myself anymore.

1542
01:37:56,010 --> 01:37:58,429
I can't stand to even look at him.

1543
01:37:58,472 --> 01:38:00,766
That pathetic, wimpy, apologetic smile.

1544
01:38:00,808 --> 01:38:03,186
- That sort of wounded puppy shit
he does, you know?

1545
01:38:03,187 --> 01:38:05,773
- What are you doing?
I'm not doing anything.
The bloom is certainly fucking off

1546
01:38:06,441 --> 01:38:09,278
the rose at this point.
- Are you screwing with me?
- No!

1547
01:38:09,779 --> 01:38:12,115
- You are screwing with me.
-Joel, I'm not!

1548
01:38:12,157 --> 01:38:14,159
- You clearly are.
- Look,

1549
01:38:14,201 --> 01:38:16,954
Let's just take a minute and--

1550
01:38:45,869 --> 01:38:48,873
Patrick, get the fuck away.
Oh, sweetheart--
Get the fuck away from me!

1551
01:38:49,832 --> 01:38:52,377
Can we talk about it?
No! Get the fuck away!

1552
01:39:25,296 --> 01:39:26,798
Joel Barish.

1553
01:39:27,424 --> 01:39:29,176
Hey, Clementine.

1554
01:39:29,218 --> 01:39:30,302
Hey.

1555
01:39:30,345 --> 01:39:32,013
Nice to see you.

1556
01:39:36,478 --> 01:39:38,397
Really very educated.

1557
01:39:38,439 --> 01:39:42,027
I mean, she's smart, I think,
but not educated.

1558
01:39:42,569 --> 01:39:45,030
I couldn't really talk to her
about books, you know?

1559
01:39:45,031 --> 01:39:47,367
She's more of
a magazine-reading girl.

1560
01:39:48,577 --> 01:39:51,414
Her vocabulary leaves
something to be desired.

1561
01:39:52,040 --> 01:39:54,626
Sometimes--
I was embarrassed in public...

1562
01:39:54,919 --> 01:39:56,087
Hi.
because she would pronounce...

1563
01:39:58,424 --> 01:39:59,467
library ''libary. ''
Hi.

1564
01:40:03,722 --> 01:40:05,057
Look what I found.

1565
01:40:05,099 --> 01:40:08,812
I think if there's
a truly seductive quality
about Clementine,

1566
01:40:09,230 --> 01:40:12,734
it's that her personality promises
to take you out of the mundane.

1567
01:40:14,737 --> 01:40:16,239
You made me look skinny.

1568
01:40:16,239 --> 01:40:18,241
Amazing, burning meteorite...

1569
01:40:18,743 --> 01:40:22,623
will carry you to another world
where things are exciting.

1570
01:40:25,001 --> 01:40:29,757
But what you quickly learn
is that...
it's really an elaborate ruse.

1571
01:40:29,799 --> 01:40:32,218
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

1572
01:40:33,471 --> 01:40:34,847
It's okay.
So flashy
in a kind of obvious way.

1573
01:40:39,479 --> 01:40:41,189
But still, it seduces you.
Joel, I really like you.

1574
01:40:41,231 --> 01:40:42,858
I hate that I said
mean things about you.

1575
01:40:42,900 --> 01:40:44,652
- Let me turn this off, okay?

1576
01:40:44,694 --> 01:40:46,905
- Hey, it's--it's only fair.

1577
01:40:48,741 --> 01:40:52,454
Where's the real Clementine?
I mean, the whole thing with the hair--

1578
01:40:52,454 --> 01:40:54,414
it's all bullshit.

1579
01:40:54,457 --> 01:40:55,917
- I really like your hair.
- Thank you.

1580
01:40:56,501 --> 01:40:58,336
I really like your hair.
Thank you.
I do.

1581
01:41:02,760 --> 01:41:04,679
You want a drink or something?

1582
01:41:04,721 --> 01:41:06,556
Do you have any whiskey?

1583
01:41:07,307 --> 01:41:10,561
No, I don't think her sex
is...

1584
01:41:11,855 --> 01:41:15,902
motivated.
I saw it clearly
the last night we were together.

1585
01:41:15,944 --> 01:41:19,740
It wasn't sex.
It was just sad.

1586
01:41:20,784 --> 01:41:22,995
Hey. Sorry.
I thought there was more.

1587
01:41:22,995 --> 01:41:26,040
The only way Clem thinks
she can get people to like her...

1588
01:41:26,333 --> 01:41:27,918
is to fuck 'em...

1589
01:41:29,253 --> 01:41:33,049
or at least dangle the possibility
of getting fucked in front of'em.

1590
01:41:33,259 --> 01:41:37,639
And she's so desperate
and insecure that she'll,

1591
01:41:38,182 --> 01:41:40,935
sooner or later,
go around fucking everybody.

1592
01:41:41,103 --> 01:41:45,066
I don't do that.
I wouldn't think that
about you.

1593
01:41:45,108 --> 01:41:46,943
- Because I don't.
- I know.

1594
01:41:47,695 --> 01:41:49,989
Because it really hurts me
that you said that
because I don't do that.

1595
01:41:49,989 --> 01:41:52,534
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry about all this.

1596
01:41:53,578 --> 01:41:56,999
I'm a little confused.
I don't really think

1597
01:41:57,040 --> 01:41:58,875
I can be here.

1598
01:42:05,635 --> 01:42:07,345
Um... bye.
Bye.

1599
01:42:09,182 --> 01:42:11,017
It was nice meeting you and all.

1600
01:42:14,355 --> 01:42:17,484
What a loss to spend
that much time with someone,

1601
01:42:17,484 --> 01:42:20,112
only to find out
that she's a stranger.

1602
01:42:25,370 --> 01:42:26,371
Wait.

1603
01:42:29,334 --> 01:42:30,418
What?
I don't know.

1604
01:42:30,460 --> 01:42:32,671
Just wait. Just wait.
What do you want, Joel?

1605
01:42:32,713 --> 01:42:34,256
I don't know.
I want you to wait for...

1606
01:42:34,507 --> 01:42:37,052
Just a while.

1607
01:42:51,029 --> 01:42:53,282
Okay.
Really?

1608
01:42:53,700 --> 01:42:55,953
I'm not a concept, Joel.
I'm just a fucked-up girl who's looking

1609
01:42:55,994 --> 01:42:57,788
for my own peace of mind.

1610
01:42:57,830 --> 01:42:59,290
- I'm not perfect.

1611
01:42:59,332 --> 01:43:01,710
- I can't see anything
that I don't like about you.

1612
01:43:01,752 --> 01:43:02,961
But you will.
Right now I can't.

1613
01:43:03,004 --> 01:43:04,464
But you will.

1614
01:43:04,672 --> 01:43:06,466
You know, you will think of things,

1615
01:43:06,508 --> 01:43:10,388
And I'll get bored with you and
feel trapped because that's what
happens with me.

1616
01:43:12,183 --> 01:43:13,726
Okay.

1617
01:43:17,732 --> 01:43:19,400
Okay.

1618
01:43:23,698 --> 01:43:25,909
Okay.
Okay.

1619
01:43:36,465 --> 01:43:47,938
